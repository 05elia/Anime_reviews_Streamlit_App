I anticipated a focus on their newlywed life, exploring their dynamic and deepening their bond. Sadly, these two episodes largely abandoned the main couple to focus on a completely irrelevant subplot involving a random NPC.

5-toubun no Hanayome*,"The Quintessential Quintuplets are back, and I couldn’t be happier!

Unlike other specials that have been released before, this one doesn’t feel like a mere attempt to “fill gaps” in the story; this time, we’re given something that, while not strictly necessary, adds so much depth to the series: the outcome of the characters’ development.

I’ve always firmly believed that if Negi Haruba, the creator of the series, excels at one thing, it’s writing characters; this was proven in the original work and is reinforced in this special. I loved seeing how the girls have grown mentally; beyond the physical changes that reflect their maturity, what truly
                  ...
excites me is how they overcame their personal struggles to achieve what they always wanted.

Fuutarou doesn’t fall behind either; seeing how his tendency to genuinely care for others wasn’t just a passing trait but has now become a core part of his personality gives him significant personal growth that’s incredibly satisfying to watch.

As for the animation, Bibury Studios did a good job; while it doesn’t quite reach the visual quality that SHAFT Studios brought to the previous specials, it’s not a disappointment either. It’s a solid effort worthy of the franchise.

The music department is another strong point; as always, both the opening and ending are carefully crafted to represent the characters in their current stage. The internal soundtrack also holds its own; I was thrilled by the inclusion of references to themes used in the first season, animated by Tezuka Studios, which were not reused in the second season or the movie. This was such a nostalgic detail that made me reflect on how much time has passed since then; who would have thought it’s been over five years already?

In conclusion, while this special might not be the pinnacle of the franchise, it delivers and doesn’t disappoint; something I deeply appreciate as a fan. I don’t know if there will be more animated works related to The Quintessential Quintuplets in the future; but if there are, I’d welcome them with open arms. And if this were the definitive ending, I wouldn’t complain either; it feels like the story that needed to be told has been told.

I highly recommend this special, especially to those who enjoy seeing character development that’s consistent and not fleeting; it’s a reminder that The Quintessential Quintuplets remains a series that knows how to connect with its fans.",Reviewer’s Rating: 10,https://myanimelist.net/anime/58755/5-toubun_no_Hanayome/reviews

Honeymoon Arc is a sweet and heartwarming continuation of the original story. It follows Futaro and the five sister as they enjoy their honeymoon, showing cute and romantic moments between them. The story also gives time to the other sisters, showing their

It's sad that this will probably the last we see of the quints for a while, especially because the manga has ended. I'm not generally into harem anime, but the Quintessential Quintuplets has something that I rarely see in other anime of this genre. The relationship that the quints have and the conflict that happens between them. How they all love Futaro but value, appreciate, and respect each other equally. I love seeing them interact with each other because you can tell the overwhelming 180° they all
                  ...
had from the beginning to the end of the series. This is not a plain harem anime, this is about how their interactions with the protagonist changed them in every way possible and affected their lives. 

One of the best parts about watching this anime was seeing each of the characters develop. Self acceptance, being your best self, overcoming pressure, nervousness, insecurities, and other stuff that teenagers will normally encounter growing up. I don't know. It hits so hard watching the quints go through it all. 

The harem itself is also perfect. There's a wide variety of characters. They all have amazing personalities, voice actresses, designs, and as I said before, character arcs/development. 

If you read this all, thank you and please give this anime a try if this interested you in any way. (I personally thought that it sucked a little at first but it gets good later on.) 

Finally, thank you to the quints, specifically Yotsuba for being my comfort character. You're beautiful, brave, funny, inspirational, relatable, and posses both mental and physical strength.

this show honestly in plot wasn't awful. some of the characters were decently written and the premise was intriguing. the main problem is the plot trying to explain away a very much grown 19 year old man marrying a 10 year old. just disgusting no matter how you slice it. i understand the backstory and reasoning for it to be that way, however what reason does the author have to make it that way? there could've been literally any other requirement for the goddess to possess someone, and yet they chose anyone over 14.
                  ...
just seems wholly unnecessary to the story at large and sets the whole vibe of the story back quite a bit. whether or not Jill is mentally in the same age group is irrelevant given that no one knows she went back in time and even then, she was only 16 in her first run so that's still highly questionable. aside from that, the villains seemed almost cartoonishly evil and something just feels missing to me. overall, it could've been a good show but was immediately run into the ground by the writers taking a weird route with the ages.",Reviewer’s Rating: 3,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55150/Yarinaoshi_Reijou_wa_Ryuutei_Heika_wo_Kouryakuchuu/reviews

The prince was just as weird and didn’t add much to the story either.  

The world-building was weak, which made it hard to get invested in the setting or the stakes. And don’t even get me started on the timeline—it felt so off and hard to follow at times.  

Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this

Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"A show with a lot of potential dismantled by a perplexing romance pairing. 

This story centers around the protagonist - Jill - who starts off as sixteen, as her ""beloved"" crown prince sets out to kill her...and succeeds. Thus, she is reborn into her own life - brought back to when she was ten years old. I do really love these types of stories! In particular, 7th Time Loop: The Villainess Enjoys a Carefree Life Married to Her Worst Enemy!

Watching a protagonist get to re-do their mistakes and make better choices is very appealing to watch - I mean who wouldn't love to get to
                  ...
do that with their own life?

However, despite this being a beloved trope of mine - this story didn't meet the potential it so very well could have. For me, at least. 

Here's for the: WHY?

The biggest letdown for me was the age gap of the love pairing. While both characters, in their own right, were interesting, charming, and endearing - having Jiil (a ten-year-old) partnered romantically with Rave (a nineteen-year-old) made for uncomfortable story telling. Being perfectly candid.

Recently, there have been quite a few age-gap romance animes to come out, but this one is the most startling of all. For example - A Girl and her Guard Dog and I'll Become a Villainess Who Goes Down in History - to name a few. However, to give those shows credit, the female protagonists were at least teenagers. 

Jill being ten for the remainder of the show as the love story progresses - for me - becomes increasingly more uncomfortable. Which, again, was disappointing as the story itself was truly an entertaining watch despite that element. 

I know the summary of this story talks of their ages, so people should go into this expecting to get just that - but I truly thought that the writers were going to handle it differently. 

How I envisioned it going was that when she was killed at sixteen, and thus reborn to being ten, she would propose to the Dragon King to avoid her perilous fate with the Crown Prince. But...then, after the proposal, they would progress the story back to her being sixteen and showing how different her life is her second time around.

She being sixteen also would have made a lot more sense regarding many of the plot points - aside from the romance. For instance, Jill is portrayed as being incredibly strong, but it's hard to imagine that a ten-year-old is as strong and powerful as she is. It would have been more believable to see her at sixteen with such immense powers. Also, she takes on a leadership role with military men that again - being a ten-year-old is hard to fathom...Would adult men really surrender to a ten-year-old's orders even with their capabilities? Unlikely. 

Despite all that, as I said, the story was pretty fun even with the critiques. 

As for a quick synopsis on the remainder of the show's elements - the art wasn't bad, but some of the recent romance animes have really been coming up with great stuff and this definitely doesn't uphold the standards they have set. Sound was fine, again, nothing overwhelming bad nor good. 

As for whether I recommend this? I think it depends on what your comfort level is. If you can handle age gap stories, then by all means give it a try. But if you're similar to me, and it's not necessarily your cup of tea, then I would steer clear.",Reviewer’s Rating: 6,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55150/Yarinaoshi_Reijou_wa_Ryuutei_Heika_wo_Kouryakuchuu/reviews
Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"Ok, I will start with how good this show is, and only then address The Problem.

The show is extremely good, and undoubtedly is a hidden gem that is lost because of unnecessary Puritan nagging! A lot of time has passed since I've watched something that dynamic. Sometimes plot twists turn the tables by 180 degrees TWICE or even TRICE a minute! The action is just breathtaking, and the authors don't think of the viewers as dummies, they say just enough to get what needs to be gotten. Sometimes I felt a need to rewind a scene, and I felt that it was not because of
                  ...
the lack of details but because of the lack of attention. And I am grateful to the creators for respecting me that much and for the abstinence from overexplaining. Partially, that is the same genre as One Punch Man or Overlord, but even here it makes the job better! Because, besides the sweet feeling that the Emperor will always crush his enemies, you still have a whole lot to worry about. Jill is still struggling, and yet, your and her main worry is that the Emperor becomes a bad guy. This ultrahero anime made the same thing The Eminence in Shadow did, but saw it through to the end! 

And guess what? Just when you start getting tired of action, this anime gives you an opportunity to rest! It brings you quite a good comedy break for around one episode. It's not a masterpiece comedy, but just enough, no, I'd say just perfect to catch your breath and be ready for new vertiginous adventures!

Now, let me tell you my two words about the 'relationships problem'. The main characters certainly didn't have physical closeness. The idea was not to seduce a child, but to nurture relationships emotionally, preparing for the future life. I get it that people are triggered. And I love how they were triggered, because by breaking contemporary stereotypes, sometimes you find something correct. I truly believe that their relationships are an ideal example of how young lads and ladies should make an engagement, foreshadowed by the good, and not the bad, examples of historical contract marriages.

Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"The anime could’ve been a solid fantasy series. The time-rewind trope always carries promise: a protagonist gets a second shot at life, learning from their past mistakes. But instead of focusing on clever plot twists or character growth, the story shoots itself in the foot by making weird romance its main trope. 

The core issue is the relationship between Jill, the 10-year-old protagonist, and Rave, the 19-year-old male lead. The romantic undertones between them aren’t just weird—they’re deeply unsettling. Dialogue like “It would’ve been better if you were 2-3 years younger” raises red flags immediately. Why in the world would a grown man wish for
                  ...
someone even younger than 10? It doesn’t stop there, either. Rave openly calls Jill his “ideal” and constantly tries to coax romantic feelings out of her, despite her being a literal child.
The weird romance overshadows everything else, which is a shame because the premise had potential.

It’s not just the dialogue, it’s the way their interactions are framed. The scenes where they cuddle or share private moments come off as outright abnormal and crazy given the size difference that is portrayed in the anime. The narrative tries to pass this off as romantic, but genuinely it makes my stomach turn. Trying to normalize this given a fantasy world really questions the author's intentions.

The show had so many ways to avoid this weirdness. A simple time skip or even aging up the characters could’ve solved everything. Instead, the story doubles down on this dynamic, and it’s impossible to ignore.

First and foremost i need to say that i did felt disgusted, blasphemous and it shivers me down to my spine. But,
                  ...
i can’t particularly find any hate for this anime other than this diabolical relationship standards thats been shoved down my throat throughout this series.

My take on this anime is If it follows our modern legals it wouldn’t be a true medieval scene. I did still rate this a 7/10 because of my today modern day moral standards that went through a battle of heavy moral conflict while watching and also reviewing this anime. If i’m talking about plot and story wise, threw aside all of my modern moral standards i’d give it a solid 8/10.

Indeed its a fantasy medieval, we all know our own world has past like this story as well. It was the social norm at our medieval time, also anything that happened in this anime was also normalized. 

As far that i can see, even the author/animator/publisher has their own moral conflicts by showing other than the MC and the Side Characters, the Norms are weirded out by the relationships of the royalties. It can also be a critique of our own world. Nonetheless i’m not defending this diabolical standards of this anime. All i say theres 2 sides of a coin, as i write this review i’m still conflicted and outraged with my decision on scoring this anime high, but the other counterparts i enjoy the well made anime and the comedy of this anime.",Reviewer’s Rating: 7,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55150/Yarinaoshi_Reijou_wa_Ryuutei_Heika_wo_Kouryakuchuu/reviews
Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"Do Over Damsel is a semi fantasy title with an interesting world and impressively strong female lead that is hidden & diminished by a creepy age gap romance between a physical 10year old & 19 year old that only gets worse with each new episode.

I would love to say that you can ignore the age gap & focus on the good but it is so prominent and built into the overarching story & characters that it simply can’t be ignored or glossed over. The first episode represents the entire show with pedophilic comments, jarring tones, conflict & rapid personality cycling. Everything devolves as episodes continue
                  ...
with lack of consequence, skipped character introductions, rapid pacing, romance progression, dog shit drama & (A BIG ONE) the regression of the female lead's strength & mentality to that of a child rather than the battle hardened leader we were introduced to in episode two, making the romance worse than it already was.

It takes 5 episodes to address the elephant in the room and when it does, it’s too late & so contrived that it makes you further question why these specific ages were chosen in the first place. The couple could have been aged up so they were both adults while maintaining the age gap or given the age of teenagers and the story wouldn’t have changed, instead the author chose a physical 10 & 19 year old to lead the story & fall in love. 

While people can state in threads that the age gap isn’t a problem due the fantasy themes & human history, everyone except the male lead IN THE SHOW is appalled by the age gap, his interest & actions towards a 10 year old that once again only get worse as episodes continue. It's played for gags in most cases but it's clear from their reaction that it is not normal in their world. The female lead also shares these feelings but at some point similar to here strength & mentality, it disappears in favor of the romance.

If you are curious about a few comments by the male lead without further clarification or answers they follow:
10 Years old is the ""Ideal age""
""It might have been better if you were two or three years younger”
“An adult is just a child who’s grown older""
""I've made up my mind to stay with you even after you've turned fourteen.""
and more…

Honestly I don’t recommend it but if I were, I would only recommend the second episode where the female lead steals the show with a commanding presence & story line somewhat disconnected form the pedophilic crap.",Reviewer’s Rating: 3,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55150/Yarinaoshi_Reijou_wa_Ryuutei_Heika_wo_Kouryakuchuu/reviews

Reincarnation, time travel, and other similar tropes are some of my favorites. This anime comes so close to hitting the mark on what i want from a fantasy series. it has just the right amount of world building that makes the environment and people feel real without sounding like a textbook. The magic system is interesting; I love that dragons were included as something other than violent monsters. In this anime they are beings of logic and royalty--as they should be.

For all the positives though, there is a major
                  ...
negative that is constantly hanging over your head while you watch: Jill is 10 years old and Hadis is 19. There is nothing comfortable about a 10-year-old being in a romantic relationship. it could be reasoned by saying it's ""period accurate"" or ""Jill is mentally 16"" but I think those are weak excuses. If the author wanted an age difference between the main couple (to allow characters to still call into Hadis' judgment for marrying a ""child""), then why not make Hadis 30 and Jill 19? Still the same difference in age but not as creepy as a 10-year-old being married off. (There's also the brief mention of the incestual relationship between the prince and princess which is also distasteful but they don't elaborate on that so it's possible that's a misunderstanding...(I can only hope)).",Reviewer’s Rating: 5,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55150/Yarinaoshi_Reijou_wa_Ryuutei_Heika_wo_Kouryakuchuu/reviews

Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"Short version: If you can overcome the obvious elephant in the room, you’re in for a great story with fun characters, comedy, intrigue and world building that you want to dig your teeth into. If the premise alone turns you off, I can’t exactly blame you though I do think the series is still worth checking out. 

Long version:

Do-Over Damsel is a Reijou series, ie a story about a mistreated young noble woman getting a new lease on life and making everyone regret treating her badly, usually by falling into a romance with a man who seems dangerous and intimidating but who ends up healing
                  ...
her as much as she does him. This is honestly a staple in Shoujo and I’m usually not a big fan of it since they often bring a “women should fix men” mentality with them but I can say that Do-Over Damsel while sharing a lot of blood with its contemporaries manages to feel fun and fresh regardless.

The biggest reason is, of course, the main character. Our protagonist Jill seems more like a Shounen hero than a Shoujo heroine at first glance: stubborn, battle hungry, glutenous and just a little bit stupid. She’s not revolutionary by any means but she does give a bit of flavour to a genre that often has protagonists who are so downtrodden they are resigned to their fate no matter how bad it gets. That’s not to say Jill is invincible of course, for all her military prowess her experience as a simple girl in love is basically non-existent and she can get insecure like anyone else which gives her character a depth that I really enjoy.

Her love interested and deuteragonist Hadis is similar, perceived as dangerous and powerful while having the personality of an absolute loser, and ends up creating an incredibly funny dynamic when combined with Jill’s all business attitude from her military life. In general, the series loves to play with contrasts between and within characters with each character having more depth than initially perceived and playing off other characters and their depths too. How much you will like it, especially the comedy bits, is subjective but I found it incredibly enjoyable.

Another part that I think made it stand out is its story and how it portrays the complicated political world royals and nobles have to navigates. While regression stories are a dime a dozen, especially in the Reijou genre, how her past and present intermingle are incredibly interesting since Jill, unlike most time travel protagonists, lacks any useful information that could be helpful outside of combat.

This gives the story tension in a way a lot of regression stories lack because she doesn’t know anyone’s motivations or plans to manipulate her way out of it and frankly, she’s a bit too stupid to do that anyway. So despite our two heroes being overpowered in combat, the political nature of the story doesn’t let them just punch their problems away, at least if they want to keep the peace. This means the characters and the writer have to get creative on how to solve things while also letting us have some cool action scenes now and then.

Speaking of the action, I think it’s worth noting that the animation isn’t that great. Not terrible by any means, especially in the first few episodes but as the series goes on you can tell that the budget ran out or the animators were seriously overworked because from composition to the artwork to the actual animation it keeps getting worse. The show does use some shortcuts to hide it and I don’t think it’s a huge detriment to the series since it’s mostly political and character driven anyway but if you expect the show to keep up the quality of the first episodes you will be sorely disappointed.

Now, I think it’s time to address The Elephant. Our protagonist is 10 years old. Granted, she is mentally 16 because of the regression but functionally that doesn’t matter since nobody knows it happened. For all intents and purposes, she’s 10 years old and her love interest is 19 going on 20. That is, to put it mildly, really really weird. Insanely weird. Ridiculously weird. “By god why would you do this?!” weird. I’m not even going to try and defend it because it’s a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge ick and by far the biggest hurdle for anyone watching the show, more than the characters, the animation and the plot combined.

Now I understand the thought process, regression stories face a problem that when a character goes back in time, there’s always the issue that they’re mentally older than their potential love interests which opens a huge can of worms. So giving Jill an older love interests closer to her mental age makes sense in that way. Why her physical age has to be that much younger and Hadis so much older is a mystery to me though and I can’t justify it beyond “the author probably liked that”.

BUT! And it’s a soft but, I think the series is still worth watching despite that huge ick because of it’s great writing and characters. If it helps at all, Jill’s child body is never sexualized in any way and her bodily autonomy is always respected. Her relationship with Hadis, while undoubtedly romantic, is not sexual in nature which doesn’t make it okay but let’s the ick go down a bit smoother. I didn’t mind it much since every Reijou series has a bit of toxicity mixed in and this series has probably the tamest instance of a huge age gap relationship with a minor I’ve seen in anime in general. I don’t think it’s as bad as, say, Mushoku Tensei, but if you can’t tolerate it at all, that’s completely fair and you should probably find a different series to watch.

Overall I still give the series a recommend because of how much I enjoyed it and think others will enjoy it too if they have any interest in the Reijou genre or Shoujo in general. I would say give it the first episode if you’re unsure if you can tolerate the elephant or not. If you can, congratulations and have fun! If you can’t, no big deal, just find something else to watch.",Reviewer’s Rating: 9,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55150/Yarinaoshi_Reijou_wa_Ryuutei_Heika_wo_Kouryakuchuu/reviews

The Do-Over Damsel Conquers the Dragon Emperor starts with an ok premise, the now generic starting over girl that will find a man that will lead her to the good ending. The story on it's on is fine, interesting enough to keep you hooked but not some hidden gem or anything like that. 

My main problem with it it's Jill's and Haidi's relashionship, a quite problematic relashion ship between a 10 year old kid and a 19 young adult. The couple's age gap is even questioned in the anime, most characters always question the fact that Jill
                  ...
is quite literally a kid, something that is only considered ""ok"" because of a convinient point in the plot. 

Even so, I still belive the anime has some good aspects, that being it's overall quality is good. The animation might not be on the level of animes like Frieren but it's also not your sesonal isekai slop with more than questionable animation. Moreover, the thicker lines around the characters give the anime some good visual identity.

I am bothered by the age gap, honestly. Japan doesnt hold back by its love for lolicons, no? *sigh*

This anime has potential at least minus the age gap of the FL and ML. Though it looks like there is no romantic (sexual) attraction at play since the FL is just with the ML because of circumstances and the ML is an immature emperor who just receive any kind of love given to him. I am just bothered by his preferences of much much younger than him. 

Other than that,

Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"Gonna take a huge controversial opinion on this big platform for ""The Do-Over Damsel Conquers The Dragon Emperor"" anime — if one can just look past the (justified) problematics of a minor betrothed to a teenage-adult, the series is a treat.

And I mean what I said. Cautionary disclaimer follows: it's *okay* to not take fiction as fact or reality. This is quite literally a safe space where no real-life actors on screen are being paid for acting out characters. It's creative - it's as fictional as it can get so let's not dwell too much into it. 

So, should you pass this up even if
                  ...
it's absolutely not up to your palate? - well....yea, please watch what you really want lol. 

For those who can conform, here's my review. 

The story this anime has BY FAR makes up for the romance issue. I definitely agree that, although setting & plot-motivated, it could have still been remedied. Okay let's get past this already. Moving on–from the time you meet Jill on screen, you're in love with her, and hooked. There is no return until you click on next, next, next episode, and it's over and you're feeling left with ""wait! what?? How is this over?? They have had to greenlit this for S2 right? right??"" 
It's such a rollercoaster of a ride - the myth-and-magic infused dark political upheavals and dynamics of this show just has you by the throat. I'm not gonna lie but Jill kept giving me flashbacks of ""Youjo Senki"" - she is just that powerful! scary? no not really, but truly a great soldier character. Her character is also well-complimented with Shuu Uchida's voice acting (my 1st time hearing her) & it's a great combo - the talent really shines and you just cannot help but love Jill! (My only wish was to see more of her 16-yo self because that's badass too)
Next, we have our love interest the Dragon Emperor voiced by Kikunosuke Toya (can you believe that this VA had voiced Chouji in ""Windbreaker""? the difference is contrasting, but an easy fan fav VA for sure) - feared by all, definitely has unresolved abandonment and abuse issues (with a lolicon complex maybe), but to Jill, he is the one looking after the house, waiting for her to return from the battlefield with the dining table set with sweet bakeries and pastries, meat, veggies, and a whole heart of love and bashfulness. He still has hope for a happy ending because of her. Can you tell I enjoyed his character? (of course you can) - I also liked his 'dark moody' character whenever he's pressed and angry too. I think the spectrum of his emotions are well-done in his character that it doesn't feel 'cringy' or too 'try-hard' and that is definitely a praise. 
Jill and the Emperor's relationship grows, albeit a little strenuously and somewhat at a disapproving pace for Jill. But the latter is just trying to survive and marrying the emperor is her trump card. So what can be done, the least is to fall in love and make sure that the dark future of the kingdom does not repeat itself and she, once again, doesn't end up dying. 

So far, it all should sound a little like ""7th Time Loop: The Villainess Enjoys a Carefree Life Married to Her Worst Enemy!"" And you'll not be wrong. ""The Do-Over Damsel Conquers The Dragon Emperor"" would be if ""7thTime Loop"" and ""Why Raeliana Ended up at the Duke's Mansion"" had an adopted daughter and ""Youjo Senki"" was an influential aunt (minus the isekai)— it makes a lot of sense to me so that's why I wrote it. It's a very good senin-jousei rom-com that has you seated throughout. And speaking of the 'comedy' in the romance - it's alright. it's at times pretty funny and other times I was neutral about it (the only 'comedy' that i nodded my head to was probably when the adults in the anime also wanted to punch the Emperor for pushing himself onto a minor)

Okay (this is already pretty long so) a few quick good points:
- animation - JC Staff is cooking in their kitchen when the cooks are good. 10/10 no notes
- overall voice acting - good stuff 8.5/10 
- music/song - OST is pretty good; Shuhei Mutsuki is the composer and there are some pretty solid A+ in the album

so, TL;DR - should you watch it? - Yes. Absolutely. You should. If you're one who understands that fiction is not real-world, this can easily be a higher-mid story series for you

Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"This had so much potential and that makes me want to give it even lower score.

The story set up was pretty decent, definitely better than most anime in this genre.  Same goes for the animation -  it was okayish nothing breathtaking but it was not a literal slide show - for the most part. But both of them get so much worse as the story goes on. We get extreme expositions dump at the start of the show. I dont understand why they didnt pace out the story more so we get to know all the characters better. The story would be also
                  ...
less rushed and we wouldnt need these pathetic info dumps. I personally believe that the first six episodes couldve been the whole series if it was written better. This way the goddess looks so pathetic - but thats not really surprising since all the villains are extremely cartoonish.  The main protagonist is also very confusing. Its like the authors cant decide what her character should be - witty, tsundere, funny, serious,... it is important for characters to be complex but this she isnt. She is a mess. Its really sad that the story had potential but it was ruined by laziness and lack of planing.

Now. For the elephant in the room. The age gap. I dont understand why so many anime are affraid to have characters older than 20. Like its so easy to fix it - goddess can poses anyone who is 18 and older, make the main girl 16 and the guy 18 meaning they were in their 20s at the start of the show which would make so much more sense??? They are really pulling that ""iN ThE oLd TimEs"", ""iTS noRMaL fOr RoyALty"" and ""hE iS AlsO juST a cHiLd"" like please. What is the point of it if you are not going to use the insane age gap for anything like... the curse could have any age, the characters dont act their age (mc does not act like she is 16 anyways), we dont see the mc being comflicted about suddenly being in prepubescent body, we have nothing.

Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"Let's start with the obvious elephant in the room: Yes, this is a story that features a physically 10 year old Jill (mentally she is 17 as she regressed after being killed) being in a relationship with the physical 19 year old Hadis. I won't try to sugarcoat that, it is one of those ideas that can easily kill the show for someone. And that's totally fine. I am also not going to say that it ""has a story reason"" because we know that the author could have just slightly changed the rules for Jill to not being physically 10. However, if that premise did
                  ...
not make you drop the show and you'd like to know how serious this matter is, let me just say these two things:

1) Jill is a character first and foremost. She is not a trophy piece for the male lead and she is also not portrayed as a fetish character. She is never sexualised at all (I know a low bar, but we know anime), meaning she is always wearing non-revealing clothing, there are no bath scenes, no underwear scenes or anything that you usually expect from anime. And I would definitely not recommend it if that was the case.
2) While the age gap can not be overlooked, one has to accept that the relationship is mostly on the emotional side and not the physical. Meaning that Hadis' and Jill's love come mostly from loving the character and what they mean for their live and not because they are necessarily sexually attracted to them. And since Jill is mentally 17, this whole aspect was not as bad as you might expect.

Now with that out of the way, what I can say about the show is that if you can look past the controversial decision, then you get a really well-written fantasy show. The anime constantly walks a fine line between serious tone and humor and while this can be jarring at times, one has to give credit to the writers for actually making something this difficult work. The humor contrasts the seriousness very well without actually undermining it. It also helps to give the characters a second side that make them more entertaining in a result.

But what is the story actually about? You have heard the premise: Jill, a warrior princess type gets betrayed by her fiancé and is going to be killed, however, instead of dying she goes back in time keeping her memories. In order to not having to get engaged with the same man again, she is proposing to a seemingly random person which turns out to be the emperor of the neighbouring country which they had a war with in the original timeline. The idea is now obviously for Jill to figure out what made Hadis the way he is in the future and how she can prevent it. However, despite her age, she is not just looking for information, since she also has a lot of magic, once she figures out what has to be done, she is fighting on the front lines as well. Which makes her an entertaining character that can carry most of the show by herself.

But the good thing is, she isn't the only reason why I consider the show well written. The other characters work well as well. Be it the male lead Hadis or even the side characters. They have a similar seriousness to them, but can also goof around which again, helps this show to never get unnecessarily dark. 

But what really made me like the show was how well the whole regression aspect plays into the story. When you hear stuff like that, you immediately think of political betrayals. And yes, this is part of it. But this show goes a bit further and actually has a really interesting story for the world involving two gods and their love/hate for one another. Not to spoil anything, the show is really well done at giving the right amount of information every time so that reveals don't become overwhelming as everything you knew changes, but still give you enough information that you can slowly but surely piece together what is the truth of the world and how this affects the present. It's one of the best in that aspect and I can only recommend it if you enjoy a mystery like that.

As for negatives (other than what has been written in the beginning) are both animation and (in some parts) pacing. Animation isn't truly bad, but it's noticable especially in the fights where the characters can be a bit too stiff. Though, I also have to say that the show comes with a fantastic soundtrack that can make you forget the not so good animation. As for the pacing, it's usually okay in my opinion, but I am also more a fan of a bit faster pacing compared to slower. But even I have to say that there were one or two moments where I would have liked if they gave it a bit more breathing room. Still, overall, it's not too bad.

In the end, the show is a really well-written fantasy show with a great balance between seriousness and humor and a strong mystery around the regressing story point. I won't tell you to forget that there is an age gap, because this is't possible, but if you do think that this might not be too much of an issue with the points I raised, then give it a shot. I feel, you won't be disappointed.",Reviewer’s Rating: 8,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55150/Yarinaoshi_Reijou_wa_Ryuutei_Heika_wo_Kouryakuchuu/reviews

Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"I highly recommend this anime! I'll start with the bad topics (because the list of good ones will be longer :P) 
> The look of the secondary characters lacks detail, which bothered me a lot. 
> So far we're on episode 3, and I missed more romantic moments without having so much comedy around. 

Right, now let's move on to the anime's positive points: 
> The music, the sound effects, the fluidity of the dialogues and the dubbing are very good, you start watching the anime and get immersed in the story
> The main character, Savalle, is very well-crafted and has a strong personality, but
                  ...
that doesn't exclude her femininity and delicacy at certain moments in the story. 
>The time-travel plot is something I'm very interested in, I thought the whole story came together very well, and I see this anime as having great potential for future seasons.
>The opening is beautiful, with a great song. 
>The features are very nice and well done (of the main characters). 
>The comedy moments worked very well to ease the tension. 

Overall, it's a fantastic anime, with a few flaws that could easily be improved. I highly recommend it if you're interested in anime of this genre

Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"So this is absolutely a very good anime,totally love this. If you are finding to watch some heartfelt Romance with the male character being obsessed with the female character this is absolutely the right anime to go with. The female character is also very strong, brave and smart and not like some damsel in distress being dumb and totally relying on the mc. The MC who is a dragon Emperor is a little bit childish which seem very cute but he becomes very serious when it comes to his wife which I love the most. ( Like the touch her and die troops will obviously
                  ...
love this anime.)
 The overall story is also great like the full anime is packed with intense drama, action and Romance obviously. It also has some comedy scene.The animation quality is also fantastic and the character designs are also great. The only problem that might seem to be there is the age of the characters like the Fl being 10 years old while the Ml is 19 years old though there is not a single weird scene or stuff about that but some people might find it problematic but in the Anime it doesn't cause any issue. This is the only reason why it can't be labelled as the  best but it is not so much of a problem because the FL is actually 16 years old and has been reincarnated into her younger self to correct her mistake in the past. The story line is actually very much interesting and good with a mix of many genres together. 
 If you want to watch something with fantasy,royalty,action,comedy, reincarnation and romance this is a very good anime to watch. It also has fighting scenes,magic and Dragons.

All the characters ignore that the main character is 10 years old. Never mind the romance line, which is completely unnecessary there by the way. A 10 year old girl is accepted as a knight, she's counseled like it's the norm. It's not the norm. 

On top of that, most of the characters act like they've been hit over the head with a board between scenes. They forget their previous words and actions as if they never happened at all.

BUT. It falls flat, and not just because of the elephant in the room (literally, they could cut out that whole ""younger than 14"" contrivance and it would make no difference to the plot). The emperor's personality is off-putting, not endearing. The plot wavers halfway through and doesn't go anywhere. The central conflict at the heart of the matter isn't well explored, and the whole thing falls flat. The action scenes aren't great.

Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"The Do-Over Damsel Conquers the Dragon Emperor is a good isekai anime with a solid story, appealing characters, and a well-developed romantic subplot. While it’s not groundbreaking, it’s definitely enjoyable and worth watching if you’re into fantasy with a touch of romance.

The world-building is well done, with an engaging setting and a plot that moves at a good pace. One of the strongest points of the anime is the romance between the two main characters. It feels balanced and well-handled, avoiding most of the clichés you usually find in similar shows. The characters have genuine chemistry, and their interactions are both charming and meaningful.

Visually, the
                  ...
show looks great. The animation is smooth, the designs are clean, and the use of color is beautiful. The vibrant aesthetic fits well with the fantasy setting and gives the whole show a polished look.

That said, there are two issues that stood out to me.

First, the implication of an incestuous relationship between a pair of siblings was unnecessary. Even though the anime never actually shows anything graphic or explicit between them, the suggestion alone feels uncomfortable and out of place. It doesn’t really add anything meaningful to the story and could have easily been left out or approached differently.

Second, the age gap between the two main characters is a bit problematic. Jill is said to be 10 years old, while the Emperor is 19. While the story doesn't push their romance into anything overly inappropriate, the visual difference between them is hard to ignore. Jill looks very much like a child, which can make certain emotional or romantic scenes feel awkward. I think the show would have worked better if Jill had been portrayed as older and more mature—something closer to 20, which would have made the dynamic between them feel more natural and acceptable. As it is, the age gap isn’t extreme on paper, but it creates an uncomfortable contrast when you see them together.

Despite those two flaws, the anime still offers a compelling and entertaining story. The mix of isekai elements, political intrigue, and character development keeps things interesting, and the romance is one of the better aspects. It’s not a masterpiece, but it’s definitely a solid watch for fans of the genre.",Reviewer’s Rating: 8,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55150/Yarinaoshi_Reijou_wa_Ryuutei_Heika_wo_Kouryakuchuu/reviews

 I will keep it simple. Watch it!

As I am writing this there are 3 other reviews: two positive, one negative. There is no point in rewriting what they wrote. The pros and cons are pretty accurate up to episode 3. However, were on episode 6 now. It's not only continued to excel at at all the good things mentioned in other reviews, but it addresses all the issues the negative review had. This is definitely more than a ""easy watch"". It starts out slow and fun, but things are
                  ...
starting to be explained. The comedy and plot balance has greatly improved after the first few episodes. You won't have to wait 12 episodes to figure out the plot. The age requirements and the history is all dealt with by episode 6. The action scenes are both fun and serious, and well done for this type of anime ( this isn't an action anime, yet it definitely treated the more serious fighting scene in episode 6 with care and appropriate weight, especially compared to the rest of fighting so far. )

The romance, although a bit weird, is enjoyable, considering it's fiction. Surprisingly, the comedy lands for me too!

The animation in the first couple of episodes was really good—felt like watching a high-quality production. However, as the episodes progressed, the quality declined. One thing that remained consistent was the sound design. It was magnificent to hear, making the scenes more impactful than they really are. The opening and ending songs were okay for me but somewhat fit the theme of the

There were some boring moments, such as exposition dumps here and there, but fortunately, they were infrequent. The plot moves at a very fast pace, almost like it's running at 1.5x speed! It was a bit surprising at first, but I got used to it as the episodes progressed.

Overall, it's a show that's heavy on exposition, tightly gripped with no sense, and full of plot holes and dumb twists.

Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"A friend recommended 'The Do-Over Damsel Conquers The Dragon Emperor' to me based on what I was watching for Fall 2024, and I'm glad I did. Jill rocks!


§ Overview

Jill Savelle was betrayed by her fiancé, and he was chasing her to be killed. Fortunately, for some reason, she was able to re-do her life. As she was about to be killed, she became younger. From 16 years old, she went back to her 10-year-old self. 

To prevent her fate from happening again, she proposes to the dragon emperor, Hadis Teos Rave, who accepts.  And from there, an unusual relationship develops.


...
§ Notes


1. Since its target audience is female (it's confusing because MAL calls this shoujo but its manga adaptation puts it as seinen), I call this 'Redo of Healer' but for females. After all, Jill redoes her life and seems wiser. Plus, there are too many moments that it tries to make the watcher feel 'diabetes.'


2. Even in her younger form, Jill is mostly overpowered, except in the last few episodes because...just watch it, please.

I had mixed feelings at first because she is so badass and seems to have it so easy. I'm glad there were moments when she seemed powerless or at least struggling.


3. Some may be infuriated with the dragon emperor Hadis because he is a borderline pædophile. He only wants to marry girls who are younger than 14, and he is 19 years old. There's an in-story reason why he is forced to only care for young girls. Again, watch this to find out.


4. Our couple are complex characters. In the old world, Jill was 16 years old, but she had the maturity of someone at least 20 years old. So in her ten-year-old body, she is a girl boss and sometimes clashes with Hadis because whatever she wants to do, she is decisive.

Hadis has the potential to be cruel and he has a lot of angst. But for much of the screen time, he displays childish behaviour. Like it or not, this somehow negates the iffy feeling that he is a pædo because of how cute his behaviour can be.


5. Most fanservice is understood to be nudity, but properly understood, it can include unnecessary scenes that might be fun to watch but don't advance the plot, e.g. sweet moments, gazing at each other, kissing, and stuff like that. In that case, there's a lot of such fanservice in this anime. For people who are neutral, you probably won't care that much. If you like this couple, you will enjoy it. But if you find their pairing sus, you will be annoyed.


6. Since Jill is just 10 years old in the present timeline, she looks incompatible with Hadis despite their chemistry. 


7. Whilst the anime has good character design, I don't see any waifu material. So if you're only interested in attractive female characters, you might not find one.


8. Since some scenes involve recollection of what would happen in the future, which was what Jill in her old life experienced, you get a good presentation of its lore and believe me, this anime is rich in it.


9. Animation is mostly standard, but the art direction sometimes be all over the place with some colours not mixing well.


§ Conclusion

If you want a badass female character, consider this. She may be overpowered, but why she became one makes sense unlike what's usually sold in Western media as Mary Sue. But this is balanced with sweet moments between Jill and Hadis, moments that will make you smile (or cringe).",Reviewer’s Rating: 7,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55150/Yarinaoshi_Reijou_wa_Ryuutei_Heika_wo_Kouryakuchuu/reviews
Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"A reverse time anime about a 16 year old girl that gets betrayed by her husband and is getting another chance at life at age 10.

Everything good until now... then it hits you. Right from the start. Her husband from her past life was the crown prince of a country, so at age 10, when the crown prince chooses her, she decides to go with another one... and that another one is 19... and he accepts her... he is overjoyed by her age...

While there is a plot reason why he is overjoyed by her age and such, it is still quite the :| moment for
                  ...
me (could have been easily changed...). But okay, let's say we get over this, what do we have then? A comedy mostly that switches between somewhat serious moments with jokes and... quite a few close, heartfelt moments between the FMC and MC... Oh man, it just likes to emphasize the fact that it is a 19 y old with a 10 y old, huh... Let's see who is the author... a female... I see... well, I did hear quite a lot of 18+ stuff is drawn by females...

Plot is basic to the point it is cringe at times for certain moments, but the main point of this anime is comedy, so ig it doesn't really matter that much, but there isn't that much comedy to make up for the plot imho. Nothing is explained when it comes magic and stuff. Worldbuilding? Ye, don't expect much. And man, sometimes it feels like you're watching on 2x for how fast the story suddenly starts developing, like they remembered they only got so much time and need to finish everything ASAP! Fighting scenes are quite meh as well. Quite a few ""perfect"" moments that aren't funny or anything, they just seem to be the copy paste of moments I've already seen in thrash animes... It's just the typical feel good story where everyone will be happy and the bed guy gets it.

There are some characters that are quite funny, but they don't appear as much as I would have wanted. MC is the strong female lead type. I like her spirit. MC is okayish? Tbh he's pretty boring to me...

Story: 7 -- There is a plotline... but it's kinda thrash anime plot style...

Art: 7 -- Art was okay. Didn't use horrendous CGI at least, but the fights were kinda 1 frame per second type most of the time, or short af.

Music: 7 -- Okay music.

Characters: 8 -- A few funny ones, but that age gap is still bugging me quite hard...

Enjoyment: 7 -- Was somewhat enjoyable, but didn't leave me with a strong impression or anything... besides that age gap.

Overall: 7

Tbh I cannot really recommend it much to anyone... there are better thrash animes out there. This one is for those that want a comedy that doesn't take itself serious, with a bit of shoujo put in it between the FMC and MC, can get over the ages of the MC and FMC, doesn't mind the generic thrash anime moments and just wants to chill at something and pass the time.",Reviewer’s Rating: 7,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55150/Yarinaoshi_Reijou_wa_Ryuutei_Heika_wo_Kouryakuchuu/reviews

Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"This anime is a refreshing and lighthearted watch that blends comedy, romance, and action in a way that feels natural and enjoyable. If you're a fan of romantic comedies, this series offers a perfect mix of humor and heart, making it a great pick for those who love a little romance with their laughs. The humor is genuinely amusing, often surprising in its delivery, and it’s one of the standout features of the show. Whether it’s through quirky character interactions or witty dialogue, the comedic moments always hit the right note without ever feeling forced or overdone.

The romantic elements also feel quite genuine, and while
                  ...
it's not the primary focus of the anime, the light romance adds an extra layer of charm to the story. It’s not the kind of romance that dominates the plot, but rather something that plays out naturally alongside the action and comedy, giving the show a well-rounded feel. If you’re someone who enjoys seeing characters develop both personally and romantically while still having fun, this anime will likely appeal to you.

The animation in this series is another strength. It’s fluid, smooth, and well-executed, especially when it comes to the fight scenes. Often in anime, action sequences can feel stiff or awkward, but here, the battles flow seamlessly and look dynamic. You won’t find yourself distracted by poorly drawn or badly animated moments, which can sometimes take you out of the experience. Every movement, whether in combat or casual interactions, is well choreographed and visually appealing. The attention to detail in the animation helps elevate the overall experience and keeps you immersed in the world the anime creates.

One of the key highlights of the anime is the soundtrack, particularly the opening and ending songs. Both the opening and ending OSTs stand out for their energy and tone, fitting perfectly with the overall vibe of the show. They’re catchy, memorable, and leave you with a sense of satisfaction after each episode. The music complements the narrative well, enhancing the emotional beats of the story and giving each moment a little more impact.

For those who enjoy a balance of romance, comedy, and action, this anime does an excellent job of catering to all those elements without letting any one aspect overshadow the others. The blend of genres feels cohesive, and nothing ever seems out of place. It’s a show that you can watch when you want to unwind and enjoy a fun, easy-going story with a bit of depth.

If you’re looking for an anime that offers humor, romance, and well-executed action in equal measure, then this is definitely a show worth watching. It’s the kind of anime that will make you smile, leave you satisfied, and perhaps even have you coming back for more episodes to see how the characters continue to grow and interact. Overall, it's a solid pick for anyone who enjoys a good romantic comedy with a touch of action, offering both light-hearted moments and satisfying fight sequences in a well-rounded package.",Reviewer’s Rating: 7,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55150/Yarinaoshi_Reijou_wa_Ryuutei_Heika_wo_Kouryakuchuu/reviews

I hate seeing so many anime still being made that have these kind of stories showing predatory situations that are being romanticized. A 10 year old girl is not an appropriate love interest for a grown man. It takes away from the story and makes almost any other aspect of the show irrelevant.

Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"Great romantic fantasy comedy, the animation is sufficient for the project, and the opening and ending are cool, the ending song is really cool, I even added it to the playlist.

I understand the unnecessary fact that the female protagonist returns to adolescence/childhood, and this can initially make the environment strange with the romantic part of a much older guy.

But the story's proposal is light and fun, with some more serious narrative moments, this is soon placed in the context of being a romance that takes place in the future, and that in the ""time"" dealt with in the work, which would be an older/medieval time,
                  ...
this was something quite normal, but he doesn't try to justify this, because as I said, the work always tries to take everything very lightly, this is not supposed to be the central point, but rather the comedy, fun, and the cuteness of the characters.

I recommend it to anyone looking for a cute work, with a light romance with some fantasy elements.

J.C.Staff, the studio responsible for the work, surprised me a little here. I had a pretty bad image of them after some poorly made works I saw, but this one is well done. It's nothing out of this world, but it's well done, and delivers what the work needs, especially in the characters' feelings.

The futuristic scenes of the male protagonist going to a bad end were very well done, they always give off a very dark vibe, and with an absurd design. I think his best design scenes are in these.

Besides, what bothers me a little about the work itself is that in the story, the way the story is told by the protagonist at the beginning, you start to hate his family absurdly, but when you get to know some people, you see that there are people there who are good, it's not that horrible scenario with no hope. The two that appear in it are really cool.

Also, another thing that bothers me is the fact that he doesn't talk to his romantic partner properly, like, if they like each other so much, some drama there wasn't necessary, especially when she is locked in the barrier, their discussion doesn't make any sense... they could just talk like people... Even if after that, this kind of thing stops happening, I still find it a bit forced...

For me, in the end the work gets a 7.5/8, I binge-watched it in 1 day, I really liked it, it would be perfect if it were made by DOGA KOBO or Kyoto Animation or OLM or any studio of that level, giving it a recent treatment like Bokuyaba, Komi-san received.",Reviewer’s Rating: 8,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55150/Yarinaoshi_Reijou_wa_Ryuutei_Heika_wo_Kouryakuchuu/reviews

Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"The main plot here is problematic to say the least.

A battle hardened teen is thrown back in time at the moment of her death to when she was 10... and was proposed to by her incest prince. To change her fate she claimed to be in love with the first person at hand, who just happened to be an adult and more than happy to take a 10 year old on it!!!!

Still, the show refuses to let you forget the status quo even for a second. 

In the first 2 episodes it looked like it was going for a typical shoujo direction with cute food and the guy being a lost puppy in need of taking care of. Then it got political and not fun anymore.

In the 3rd Episodes the animation took a dive and the cost cutting methods started to get more painful.

Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"First being hunted by your fiance, because of false charges of treason. To then be taken back in time and become betrothed to your former enemy, is certainly a hard start to a new attempt of life.

This show follows Jill and Hadis, who have become betrothed after Jill was taken back in time. We see them have to figure out their own situation and relationship, as Jill also tries to stop certain events from unfolding the same way as they did in her previous time.

The plot of the show very much revolves around Jill wanting a life that doesn't end the same way as the
                  ...
last one, and to avoid a future where Hadis turns into the enemy she formerly knew. This is done with fairly straightforward plot arcs, where throughout there are a few flashbacks to Jill's former life. Through that do we get a broader perspective of situations and with it more insight into the plot, characters and setting. So we get a smooth straightforward plotline that expands itself with flashbacks and sometimes some unknown twists, which really makes the story appealing.

For the characters they are well written and have some unique details to them, with some having more underlying details then others. For the two main characters, they are very much built up to have their big character progression happen over the full length of the story, with the show only showing some milestones for their development. But when we then look at the side characters, is it actually clear that they are built to be able to go under transformation and change their ways. We also see how some of them harbor greater secrets then others, and some take more time to acclimate to the coming change. This all gives a feeling of knowledge in relations the characters have between each other, which overall shapes a great dynamic that forms around the plot.

Animation wise do they switch between some different styles, where each style is very clearly connected to some type of scene. This is for example more chibi design for the silly and fun moments, while combat and serious scenes has a more mature and detailed animation style to it. Though throughout the show there is a more cartoonish feel to it, which is not necessarily bad, since it gives it a bit of uniqueness to the show. This choice in animation also really pairs up well with  the characters and plot.

Sadly for the whole show there is one big drawback, which is the age difference between Hadis and Jill, Jill being 10 and Hadis around 19, Jill was 16 in her former timeline. This type of relationship and those ages, can easily become something very wrong. But the show has saved it in a way that makes one less critical around their relationship, which is done through no fan service, no sexualization, and generally building it around wholesomeness. With it they succeeded in it being a cute relationship, instead of a sexualized one.

So with all that it is a great show with a questionable couple they portray in the best way possible. Thereby I will definitely recommend you watch this, if it is a genre you like or just that you find the idea of the show interesting.",Reviewer’s Rating: 8,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55150/Yarinaoshi_Reijou_wa_Ryuutei_Heika_wo_Kouryakuchuu/reviews
Yarinaoshi Reijou wa Ryuutei Heika wo Kouryakuchuu,"this is so bad, i felt obliged to write my first review

the special effects and the cinematic scenes is great, but the animation is simple. the character designs are generic, but the polish is good. it looks good enough as a whole with the slight thickness of character outlines, a stylistic choice similar to critically acclaimed Kimetsu no Yaiba. the side-characters' backstories have great potential. i personally enjoy op protagonists, and their contrast with mediocre side-characters, but both lead characters are way overpowered by birthright that it's lame

the antagonist is too overconfident and terrorizing to both of the lead characters for how powerless he is
                  ...
despite losing face and getting his az kicked countless times, showing only rage, and neither sign of fear nor shame; they gave him the plot armor of a protagonist. his obsession with the female lead is also obnoxious and makes no sense

the female lead feels like she juggles personalities so abruptly like multiple ghosts possessing her and fighting over her body. it's also very unsettling to hear all the cheesy, cringe, somewhat flirty dialogues between a rather young girl even by medieval anime standards, and a male lead with an ""i can fix him"" mental fragility and the rationality of a man-child. both their personalities cater well to western ""modern audiences."" anyone who thought this was good should send an application to Ubislop.

the ﻿plot is needlessly overcomplex, and even more so with the haphazard pacing and storytelling. ﻿it was hard to tell, but this is the worst thing i've ever seen in either shojo or reincarnation genre, and im just as stupid for taking 6 episodes to realize i was being baited something good was actually going to happen

Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu,"A Refreshing Workplace Romance

Workplace romances in anime are rare, and even when they appear, they often lean into unrealistic tropes. I Have a Crush at Work takes a different approach—one that embraces realism while still delivering the charm of a classic rom-com. 

The story follows Yui Mitsuya, a competent yet somewhat reserved office worker, and Masugu Tateishi, her diligent coworker. Their workplace romance begins in secret, which leads to both comedic and heartfelt situations. The show does an excellent job of portraying the nuances of dating in a professional environment, from stolen glances at meetings to the fear of getting caught by nosy colleagues.

While the
                  ...
premise itself isn’t groundbreaking, I Have a Crush at Work excels in its execution. The chemistry between Yui and Masugu feels genuine, and their relationship doesn’t rely on excessive misunderstandings or forced drama. Instead, the tension comes from real-world issues: workplace professionalism, personal boundaries, and navigating love while maintaining a career.

 I personally enjoyed how their relationship develops naturally instead of being rushed. Many romance anime struggle with pacing, either dragging things out too long or pushing relationships forward unnaturally fast. Here, it’s a smooth progression, making the romance feel organic and believable.

One of the standout aspects of this anime is how maturely it handles romance. Unlike the usual high school rom-coms where misunderstandings drag on for episodes, Yui and Masugu actually communicate. When issues arise, they talk it out rather than sulking in silence for half the season.

Also, the professional setting adds an extra layer of realism. Unlike Wotakoi, which focused on office workers who were also otaku, I Have a Crush at Work keeps things grounded, showing real concerns like power dynamics, workplace gossip, and career implications. It doesn’t overly dramatize these aspects but acknowledges them enough to feel authentic.

Studio Blade did a solid job with the animation. It’s not flashy like Jujutsu Kaisen or Solo Leveling, but it doesn’t need to be. The art style is crisp, and character expressions are well done, which is crucial for a romance anime where subtle facial movements matter. The color palette is warm and inviting, matching the relaxed yet emotionally engaging atmosphere of the series.

The voice acting deserves praise too—both main leads deliver performances that enhance their characters’ personalities. Yui’s slightly awkward but sincere tone and Masugu’s calm, composed manner make them feel real rather than over-the-top anime archetypes. The background music complements the show well, with soft piano pieces during emotional moments and lighthearted tunes for comedic scenes. While the animation won’t blow you away, it serves the story well. The subtlety in character expressions adds depth, and the voice actors elevate the dialogue. 

🔹 Pros: realistic romance, strong character chemistry, great pacing, mature and relatable themes.
🔹 Cons: Lacks high-intensity drama (which might not appeal to everyone); art style is good but not standout.

Romance anime often struggle to evolve beyond high school settings, but I Have a Crush at Work proves that adult relationships can be just as interesting—if not more so.

 If you’re tired of rom-coms where everything feels exaggerated, this anime is a solid pick. It’s a refreshing change from the usual high school settings and presents romance in a way that feels closer to real life.

At first glance, Can You Keep a Secret? seems like your typical office romance anime—lighthearted, maybe even predictable. But give it a few episodes, and you’ll realize it’s far from ordinary. This anime manages to blend romance, realism, and subtle humor in a way that keeps you hooked, all while making your cheeks hurt from smiling!

Story & Pacing

Unlike many romance anime where couples take an entire season to develop, this show flips expectations. The relationships form naturally and progress at a realistic pace, making it feel mature rather than dragged out. The ""will-they-won't-they"" tension is replaced with
                  ...

Characters & Chemistry

One of the anime’s strongest points is how well-written its characters are. The main couple has fantastic chemistry, and the supporting cast adds depth without unnecessary drama. The romantic developments are subtle yet satisfying, making each interaction feel meaningful rather than forced. It avoids overused clichés while keeping things fun and engaging.

Overall Experience

This anime is a cozy watch—one of those rare gems that feels both heartwarming and mature. It doesn’t rely on exaggerated drama or misunderstandings to create tension, making it stand out from typical rom-coms. If you're looking for a romance anime that respects its audience and characters while still delivering feel-good moments, Can You Keep a Secret? is a must-watch.

Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu,"I've seen several people complaining about this anime, and while I respect everyone's opinions, I think most of these complaints don't have much of a solid basis. The biggest reason people seem to complain is that the romance is already firmly established from the first episode, which is quite different from most anime.

Because of this, it feels like an anime without a real conflict or goal, which is very different from typical romance anime. The fact that the main characters are a couple who openly show their affection, love, and desire for each other from the start can make some people uncomfortable.

That being said, I
                  ...
do agree that this anime lacks some drama or conflict. In theory, ""the biggest obstacle""—which would normally be the development of their relationship—has already been overcome. The only real ""conflict"" is their attempts to keep their relationship a secret. While that is important, it's not the main focus.

Another common complaint I've seen is that it makes it clear that the couple is sexually active, and this is shown in multiple episodes. I find this funny because, while it's true, I don't see anything wrong with it. Ironically, people don't seem to complain about this in the Ecchi genre. And while this anime doesn’t really have anything ecchi or provocative—except for one non-explicit scene—I don't see the issue.

It's a cute and enjoyable anime that doesn’t rely on as many clichés as other romance anime. Even though it’s still an anime, I think it tells a believable story and is genuinely a solid concept. Two adults, co-workers, trying to keep their office romance a secret. A simple plot? Yes. Functional? Absolutely.

I’m not sure what else to add. Everyone has their own tastes, and that’s fine, but I don’t think these complaints hold much weight.

Personally, I do recommend this anime. It’s not the best I’ve ever seen, but it’s entertaining and very sweet. The main characters have great chemistry, and while the supporting cast isn’t particularly outstanding, they’re still enjoyable.",Reviewer’s Rating: 8,https://myanimelist.net/anime/59361/Kono_Kaisha_ni_Suki_na_Hito_ga_Imasu/reviews

Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu,"Not only was it the best romance of the season, we're also facing the best office romance.

The story is simple, an office romance that wants to remain hidden between the parties. Kono Kaisha arrived without any kind of spotlight on it, and it's not like it really needed it. The story knew it had the necessary quality to attract attention without even the need for publicity. The anime doesn't just aim to place two lovebirds in an office so they can constantly display affection. They play with the elements of a secret romance to tell various aspects of the protagonists' lives. During work, the focus
                  ...
is on professional and work-related topics. While during free time, it's when we get mushy. This duality suits the show quite well because it never feels cloying, but it also doesn't feel like it's trying to preach at your work life, if you're at that stage of your life.

The way it portrays office life is very accurate. It doesn't try to romanticize it but rather shows us a picture of reality. It shows how two people have to juggle their professional and personal lives while having a relationship they try to hide from their colleagues. On the professional side, they show us the harshness of the schedules and the unexpected overtime, but they also show us the hunger for growth, the pursuit of new projects, and the pursuit of new opportunities. Every adult knows that work isn't easy, but it's also true that we can enjoy this place where we spend more time than at home. On the personal side, they show how each of them views the relationship from both perspectives, both male and female. Each gender has its own ideas and concepts of what it means to be in a relationship. Friction is inevitable, but it's healthy for a relationship that has good communication; in the end, a relationship grows through conflict and reconciliation. I don't know if it's worth mentioning, but I know many people enjoy these types of references. The relationship is adult throughout, not only in the conflicts and thoughts, but also in the actions. At various points, they make it very clear, without being explicit or morbid, that the protagonists are sexually active. As I said, I don't know if it was worth it, but it's an element within the show.

One aspect that adds many points to the show is that what other romances this season didn't do, Kono Kaisha did twice. I mean, building a good romance. The main couple starts off established, so we don't get to see the back-and-forth that usually exists in the pre-relationship phase. The anime didn't settle for just one couple and showed us it knows how to handle romance by building a secondary couple completely from scratch. The best thing is that this couple is built and formalized over the course of two episodes, with a short but precise development. At no point does it feel forced or rushed; everything falls perfectly into place.

Kono Kaisha isn't good just because its protagonists love each other so much. It's good because it demonstrates and develops that even in the most mundane spaces of adult life, a feeling as beautiful and fleeting as love can exist. That such a brilliant feeling isn't something that can be kept hidden, because it always seeks to emerge.",Reviewer’s Rating: 10,https://myanimelist.net/anime/59361/Kono_Kaisha_ni_Suki_na_Hito_ga_Imasu/reviews
Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu,"In the desert of romance anime, there seems to be countless tired, boring, and cliché titles that all feel the same, with no development or even actual relationships. But this feels like a tall, cool glass of water. A refreshing take on romance that romance fans need much more of. I Have a Crush At Work is an adult romance anime that follows two office workers in a secret relationship. By adult, I mean two actual adults who are in a relationship. And thanks to this one aspect alone, this is more interesting and compelling than most high school anime. 

The story follows two office
                  ...
workers, Masugu and Mitsuya as they live their lives having a secret office relationship. The story is simple, but the setting and characters are what makes it effective. There's no high school melodrama nonsense, no cringe misunderstandings with over the top reactions, and it has actual romantic development between the two lovers aside from just holding hands or finally getting that first kiss. Seeing two adults together, well into their relationship and acting with maturity is this show's greatest strength From choosing to sleep over at one another's apartments, choosing vacations to go on, or discussing each other's daily stresses, you can see an actual relationship happening. It all feels grounded and believable.

The story and plot beats tread familiar territory with nothing too out of the ordinary, but I enjoyed see two adults with adult problems and jobs. It explores the daily struggle of keeping a secret romance from coworkers, the stress of a job, as well as their ever deepening relationship. If you're a fan of slice of life elements mixed in with romance, this is a fun and easy going watch.

The real meat and potatoes of the series is its characters. As explained prior, everyone is an adult and this is to the series' advantage. Everyone seems down to Earth, reasonable, and mature. Of course everyone has their quirks, insecurities, and flaws, but it all comes in a believable package. Masugu and Mitsuya's relationship is the main focus, and when they're together is when the series is at its best. Seeing their after work interactions is what it's all about. Some other characters get their own development, and it felt substantial enough without taking away from the main couple. The best part for me is that even during times of conflict or doubt, the characters handled things in a level-headed and reasonable way, like an adult should. Much different than your run of the mill high school romance. 

Visually, this is also nothing to write home about. The art is fairly basic, but it's attractive enough to keep your attention. Plenty of nice cityscape backgrounds and locales. The animation would be considered standard for a TV anime. The music is also nothing special, but it does its job.

Overall, if you're looking for a series with a relationship with real development, void of any cliché kiddie nonsense, look no further than this refreshing and comfy series.",Reviewer’s Rating: 8,https://myanimelist.net/anime/59361/Kono_Kaisha_ni_Suki_na_Hito_ga_Imasu/reviews
Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu,"Romance anime can be a mixed bag. On one hand you’ve got the nearly incessant barrage of seasonal high school romance wherein teenagers experience their first love and spend an entire season building up to a confession, on the other you’ve got the occasional adult romance where the only difference between the cast and the teenage romance I just mentioned is that they’re physically adults. However, they don’t actually do anything to set themselves apart as adults. They just feel like physically older teenagers doing the same stupid stuff, not communicating, running from their feelings and acting like losers whenever they’re around the opposite sex.
                  ...
Enter Konosuki, I have a crush at work. It blows my mind how this didn’t get licensed by the major streamers because I can confidently say this is one of the best romance anime in this medium. No BS, no buildup to confession or couples being overly nervous with each other, we start the series with our main couple together and get 12 amazing episodes of them growing closer, strengthening their bond all while balancing their workplace commitments. If you’re tired of the usual anime romance and want to see actual adults acting like adults while dating and dealing with the same things you deal with on a daily basis, look no further. This is a must watch.

The very first episode of this show had me hooked. When I saw our main couple get together so soon, I knew this was going to be special and it didn’t disappoint. Yui and Masugu are absolutely adorable and one of the best ships I’ve ever seen in anime and it’s not like they’re some unrealistic idealised couple. They’re two very normal down to earth people that most of us will be able to relate to. They’re a great couple, but they’re also much more than that. I like how the series goes out of its way to show us that Masugu and Yui are their own individuals with their own interests and goals. Yes, they love being around each other, but they’re also focused on improving themselves and doing what they want to in life. It’s such a healthy dynamic and combined with the pleasant work environment where their creative interests are encouraged and fostered, I had a smile on my face every week. We see so many horror stories in anime and in real life with Japanese companies abusing their employees, so to see one where the employees are not just respected, but really treated like individuals and listened to and pushed to pursue the things they want, resonated with me. 

I am also a massive fan of how all the characters in the story actually voice whatever’s bothering them. If Yui is upset about something, Masugu won’t let it go and will get her to actually spill the issue, allowing them to compromise or work through it by the end of the episode. It’s one of those things that might seem mundane to some, but for me it takes a series from good to great because the characters behave in a realistic manner allowing me to become more immersed in and attached to the story and characters.

This is probably the first anime I have ever seen where sex is handled so casually and maturely too. Look, people have sex, especially when they’re in a relationship. Anime has a tendency to hyper fixate on it and make it such a big deal. That intimacy of sharing your body with someone is certainly important, but it doesn’t need to be made into a spectacle either. Masugu and Yui have casual sex at least 4-5 times in here and the show doesn’t make it out to be a fanservice moment or use any perverted camera angles, it’s literally just a natural progression of their dates and it feels real as hell. I really don’t think an anime has ever done it this well, hats off the author and the staff for showcasing sexual intimacy in such a mature way. 

Masugu and Yui are the main draw, but there’s a supporting couple that starts getting going at the end that I honestly kind of liked more than our main ship. Both are very realistic and well written, but Hayakawa’s little arc resonated with me even more because of the opposites attract situation. The author really knows how to write compelling couples and they seem to have a great understanding of human psychology. I just love when anime feels real. Yea, fantasy and over the top stuff is cool and all, but sometimes I want to watch something that could happen in real life!

My one complaint with the story is that the whole hiding the relationship from everyone at work gimmick doesn’t make too much sense after a while, especially when it’s clear that the workplace would have no issue with it given there’s no power dynamic imbalance and everyone at work is chill as hell. The show largely acts realistic and the two leads talk through their problems, they say what bothers them and don’t let things snowball, other than this.. but it’s sort of a minor thing. It is a fictional story and you’ve got to have some sort of gimmick to keep things engaging, I get it. 

The show looks great, love the character designs for Yui and Hayakawa especially, seiyuus are amazing and really do a good job of not sounding over the top. They go with the more natural lower tone voices and it only makes things more immersive! I have zero complaints with this show really. Knew it was going to be one of the best shows of the season from the start and it ended that way.

Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu,"I'm iffy about this one. I'm not a fan of the whole ""dating in secret"" troop ( though i did enjoy it when i was in my teens), but I can always admit when its done well and this wasn't done all that well - at least in my opinion. It seems rather immature and unnecessarily stressful to go out of ones way to try to not get caught dating your coworker outside of work.  I can understand wanting to maintain professionalism in the work place, and for them to act like they aren't a couple at work- but why continue to maintain that
                  ...
outside of it? At times its like- are they even dating? Do they understand the meaning of what it truly means to date someone? The characters feel like they're in high school with their mentalities, and not adults in their mid to late 20's. They don't want their relationship to be known to avoid awkwardness, but that's what's causing everything to be well- awkward. And calling certain things 'cute' about one another that would otherwise raise a red flag- not my cup of tea.

This isn't my favorite office romcom and I had such high hopes for it. But I will be fair and rate a 6. It has potential to be really good- its just not there yet.

only stick out compared to the rest of the romance genre, but utilize story beats that really enhance the narratives in the anime. ‘I Have a Crush at Work’ revolves around Masugu Tateishi and Yui Mitsuya, two office workers in the same company but in different departments. To the rest of their colleagues, these two are constantly at odds, but secretly, are dating and share a very intimate relationship. I don’t mind the secret lovers trope in storytelling, but ‘Can You Keep a Secret?’ fleshes out this trope to the best of the story’s ability, and it worked really well for me. I like the fact that both Masugu and Yui don’t work in the same department and I think their professional personas help contrast not only how they operate in the office environment, but also how they are in their private life. Easily the strongest aspect of this anime’s writing has to be the romance itself. First and foremost, the main couple is already in the relationship at the start of the show, only elaborating on how they began dating in the last episode. I like the fact that the main narrative of this anime isn’t revolving around whether or not the two main characters will date each other, and instead throws the audience right in the middle of their relationship. Speaking of, how the show actually fleshes out the romantic dynamic between Yui and Masugu further adds to just how good the romance was written in this series.

I know this is going to sound like I’m horny-baiting, but I’m actually starting to miss romance storylines where the characters show any level of intimacy or passion in their relationship. ‘Can You Keep a Secret?’ is one of the very few modern romance anime where the main characters are actually passionate in their relationship. No, we don’t see the characters raw-dog each other or anything, but having scenes where the characters can just be all feely with one another is honestly refreshing as well as further characterizing the current state of Masugu and Yui’s dynamic. The main couple isn’t in yet another “will they/won’t they” relationship; we see Tateishi and Mitsuya going on dates where they can truly shine as an actual couple. We also get to experience just how truly intimate these characters are with one another without straight-up showing us anything NSFW. Sure, there are moments where the show might delve into the more erotic side of the relationship, but we are given plenty of scenes that heavily imply where Mitsuya and Tateishi are emotionally with one another. This type of romantic characterization is more realistic for adults who have been dating for a while, without going all HBO/Netflix on us with endless sex scenes. I Have a Crush at Work maintains a great balance between the more touchy intimate side of the romance with some cute and wholesome moments between the characters, exploring all faucets of Masugu and Yui’s dynamic with each other. I also liked how the main couple struggles at work and how they lift each other up whenever one of them feels down and stressed due to whatever their jobs throw at them. The dates that these characters go on are not only wholesome, but further add and enrich the romance, making this more than just cutesy interactions and passionate moves that the partners make at one another.

Earlier, I mentioned and praised how the main couple isn’t yet another “will they/won’t they” dynamic. While this trope has gotten tiresome within romance anime, it can work really well when the story beats and plot points are laid out in a way that is compelling. We’ve had recent hits like The Dangers in My Heart that utilize this trope in - at least in my opinion - a very compelling manner that made the two seasons of that show a very enjoyable watch. While the main focus of this show isn’t focused on this type of romantic storyline, ‘Can You Keep a Secret?’ also features a side couple that does make use of this trope revolving around Shizuno Hayakawa and Keisuke Somei. Now to anyone who has watched this show, you might be thinking that Shizuno and Keisuke having a romantic dynamic with each other is pretty taboo, considering that Shinzuno is eight years older than Keisuke, and while we can argue whether or not there should be anything alluding to a romance between these two characters, remember that these are responsible adults. One aspect that I was worried about was how Hayakawa, considering her age, might manipulate Somei into whatever happens in their dynamic, but this show does an exceptional job fleshing out Shizuno’s character and her past romantic experiences, especially in relation to dating her co-workers. I don’t want to give too much away about this subplot because I actually think this storyline is best when experienced without knowing much going into it, but these two characters actually go through a very interesting and compelling narrative that I thought was handled really well. While this show mainly focuses on Masugu and Yui, we are given short but concise scenes between Hayakawa and Somei that not only gradually develop their dynamic with one another, but also make their culmination episode very impactful. The dedicated episode is easily one of my favorite episodes of this season, so much so that I’m basically tip-toeing around outright mentioning how that narrative turns out because I truly recommend anyone who plans on watching this series to go in blind and fully take in how that storyline plays out.

Overall, I really enjoyed I Have a Crush at Work. This anime is just my type of thing: adult office romances that explore the many aspects of a relationship, while maintaining a fun and cozy atmosphere. ‘Can You Keep a Secret?’ is a very refreshing entry in the oversaturated romance genre of anime and I would recommend this to anyone.",Reviewer’s Rating: 8,https://myanimelist.net/anime/59361/Kono_Kaisha_ni_Suki_na_Hito_ga_Imasu/reviews
Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu,"-Why watch Kono Kaisha ni Suki?
If you've ever watched any anime of this category, you probably know that usually it takes a long time to develop the main couple's relationship, with characters that are often generic and with generic stories (60-70% of these animes are school romances, a genre that was very popularized by Toradora and Oregairu, but few anime manage to take inspiration from them and do a good job). Returning to the topic, in the case of this anime, it starts with a small difference: it's not a school romance that we're already used to seeing with withdrawn teenagers. We have adults who,
                  ...
it sounds like a joke, but they ACT LIKE ADULTS. The anime doesn't follow those clichés of romcoms that go to great lengths to show tiny progress in the relationship of the main couple, but rather just develop an already established relationship.

-What kind of romance is this?
It's a no-nonsense romance anime with the main couple's relationship developing VERY FAST.

-What about the plot?
Well, as simple as the plot is, it's not bad, because he does the simple well. There are some funny scenes, the main couple has an interesting chemistry and the plot isn't boring as you sometimes worry if they will be found out or not.

-Side characters?
We have some interesting secondary characters that get better developed over the course of the anime, but most of them are underdeveloped in order to focus more on the main couple and some other events.

-Animation?
Studio Blade (the studio responsible for the production of the anime) is a small studio with only a few anime in its history, but nevertheless it has managed to deliver good animation, nothing amazing of course, but it's good.

Weak points?
I feel that the anime rushes a lot of events and ends up cutting some very important scenes from the original material in order to fit it into 12 episodes, which makes for a strange feeling, especially in the last few episodes. Also, as I said before, some of the characters are poorly developed, which might be a negative point for some. I also can't forget that not everyone likes the kind of romance in this anime, which is ridiculously faster than most other anime in the genre.

-(Extra) What other anime does this look like?
If you want quotes from some anime similar to Kono Kaisha to get a better idea or just want recommendations of similar anime if you don't know them, read below:
Some of the plot and characters in this anime remind me a lot of Otaku ni Koi, as it deals more with adult office romance. In parts of Kono kaisha, it becomes a little slice of life, as it deals a little more with the everyday life of the protagonists, which reminded me a lot of Tonikaku Kawaii.

-Conclusion
Here we have a big surprise from 2025. Kono Kaisha is the kind of anime that takes a long time to appear, but when it does, it stands out precisely because it shows a more realistic relationship. For those who are not used to see romances of this type, probably might be quite surprised with this anime. As for the ending, without giving away any spoilers of course, I can say that it's complete and quite satisfying, even if it's worse than the one in the manga, because they left out some events that would have ended the story in an even better way. In short, if you like this type of romance, which is more realistic and which breaks away from the cliché of teenage school romances, I recommend this anime.",Reviewer’s Rating: 9,https://myanimelist.net/anime/59361/Kono_Kaisha_ni_Suki_na_Hito_ga_Imasu/reviews
Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu,"Another one of the shows that has a great general premise, but then doesn't do much with it for most of its runtime. The main recommendation I got for this show was that it was ""different"" to a lot of other romance shows and if you just look at the surface level elements, then you might even agree. After all, this show starts of by having the two characters already be in the relationship and they even have sex in the first episode. But if you look past these simple changes, then you will notice that the romance isn't that much different from your typical
                  ...
romance. Which is a shame, because it didn't have to be.

So let's start with the first aspect, the fact that they are already together. While most hail this as a revolutionary idea, it just creates more problems than it ""solves"". Don't get me wrong, I also dislike how most romance shows out there try to keep the status quo for too long and the characters awkardly move around just starting a relationship, but you don't solve that issue by just skipping that phase. Because now, it's kind of hard to get into their relationship as it's implied at several points that they have some kind of backstory with one another (they've known each other for a while) and you get hints every now and then, but this can't solve the problem that we completely missed out on that development. Why not have at least 3-4 episodes of them getting together? Why is that not an option? You might say, they want to get to the meat of the story right away, but that is the next issue, there isn't actually much meat to the story.

The story is more or less a Slice of Life show where it's about the two main characters Yui and Masugu who want to become better in their carrer paths while also having a relationship with one another. And since the focus is more on that career part of the equation, the romance between the two feels heavily underdeveloped despite them already being together. Yes, they often play the typical tropes of a romance anime, but it feels so hollow very often, because at the end of the day, it is still the same as other romance shows where the status quo of the relationship won't be be changed. It might allude to it every now and then, but once that moment is over, we are back to the usual. And the worst part, it didn't have to.

I am not even talking about big drama here, but as mentioned above, the main focus is them both advancing their careers which comes with its own hurdles. And this could have been used effectively to develop their relationship. As most people probably know, if you have stress at work, having someone you can rely on, even if it is just for not being alone is a great thing to have. And the show is at least acknowledging that. But instead of using moments like these to develop their relationship (as they understand how much it gives them to just be together with the other person and therefore wanting to take the next step for example), afterwards it's right back to career progression.

And that is also why I can't really see them having sex immediately as a positive. Again, I like that the show doesn't shy away from the topic and I am not arguing that it is unrealistic for them to have sex immediately after getting together. It is quite realistic in fact. But realism doesn't make for a good story. A story lives off the fact that things develop. Getting intimate with one another as a sign of taking the next step in a relationship. It is exactly one of those potential signs to show that they are not just staying at the same level but they are progressing. But since they were already doing it from Day 1, there is no potential for development here and you are still stuck with the same tropes you've seen in other shows.

At the end of the day, the show seems to really try to surprise by subverting the surface level elements that people are usually criticising about romance show. That being, the characters not getting together and them shying away from being intimate. But it completely fails to undestand WHY this criticism is made. The underlying criticism of romance shows is the lack of development, both on an emotional side (them not being able to just confess and get together) as well as on a physical side (them shying away from intimacy). So the show just ""adressed"" this by skipping these parts, thereby creating the same lack in development every other romance has.",Reviewer’s Rating: 6,https://myanimelist.net/anime/59361/Kono_Kaisha_ni_Suki_na_Hito_ga_Imasu/reviews
Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu,"I absolutely loved this anime — it instantly became one of my favorites! ❤️

The office romance theme felt refreshingly mature and realistic. Instead of overly dramatic or exaggerated emotions, the show portrayed relationships in a subtle, grounded way that really hit home. The atmosphere, pacing, and emotional build-up were all very well handled, making it a relaxing and heartfelt watch.

While the main couple had their charm, I personally fell in love with the dynamic between Keisuke Somei and Shizuno Hayakawa even more. Their chemistry was beautiful, and their moments together were some of the most emotionally satisfying in the entire series. They felt genuine, well-written,
                  ...

The animation style matched the slice-of-life tone perfectly, and the soundtrack added a nice emotional layer without being overbearing.

The characters weren't meant to be outstanding, the fact that they're all boring all the more makes them more relatable and attractive. The overall story is what takes the cake here, it's supposed to be a vanilla office romcom, and it executed it well.

Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu,"I Have a Crush at Work — An office/workplace romance in 2025 that's way better than expected? What in God's name did we ever do to deserve this?

The one of the few Winter 2025 titles that neither Crunchyroll nor other Western contemporaries have managed to license out of the cesspool of the majority of shows that fare worse, you'd think that at least they have a show that, say, isn't from the likes of Hidive's S-Rank Behemoth, which is almost borderline Hentai, or Amazon Prime's Ubel Blatt, which is over-the-top violence and gore. And it's in this hindsight that the Asian Chinese streaming entities of
                  ...
Bilibili (alongside Ani-One Asia) will take cover for the shows that, while their appeal will vary, sometimes this is easily a W for the rare case to say that Crunchyroll just does not cater to specific shows due to silly reasons we will not know. And for mangaka Akamaru Enomoto's completed series of Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu a.k.a I Have a Crush at Work, I've got to say that this goes way beyond what similar contemporaries have done prior and is by far the best representation of the workplace romance aspect.

I swear to you, this series just gets it right the first time and gets even better down the road.

Romance, with realism, that goes all the way. That is the way to describe Kono Kaisha when you combine office romance shows like Fall 2021's Senpai ga Uzai Kouhai no Hanashi a.k.a My Senpai is Annoying, or Summer 2023's Uchi no Kaisha no Chiisai Senpai no Hanashi a.k.a My Tiny Senpai (which they're more or less the same thing) is one of the best shows in its subgenre: Spring 2018's Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii a.k.a WotaKoi: Love is Hard for Otaku. It has everything that you wanted from those shows, but to take out what's trash in those series and throw them in the garbage.

In essence, trade out what you know about those characters, and you get them in this fashion: The main couple of Masugu Tateishi and Yui Mitsuya is that of Senpai ga Uzai's boisterous male MC Harumi Takeda and Uchi no Kaisha's Shiori Katase (if you remove the boisterous boobs that she has). Of course, like Senpai ga Uzai, its side couple of Souta Kazama and Touko Sakurai has an equivalent in this series (though that would already be treading in spoiler territory, so let's not go there), but just like WotaKoi, every character has its moment to shine so much so that even though we already know who the main couple is and their romance shtick that's just like last season's Kekkon suru tte, Hontou desu ka a.k.a 365 Days to the Wedding, but quick and swift, and even with unapologetic sexual allures that range from hand-holding to kisses and even unadulterated (and though censored) sex...? Sign me up, fam, because this is revolutionary.

I just love that even though the office romance subgenre has been explored in anime for far longer than we imagine, it's always up to the author him/herself to depict how different it would be, its settings, and the like; that always keeps it fresh. And obviously, this show caters to the working adults who (I'm guessing) are Millennials or even Gen Zs who are already in the workforce but on the cusp of finding the taboo that is the unspoken word of office romantic semantics. That's the reason why this show has an alternative name of ""Can You Keep a Secret?"" because, in reality, office romances can only be best summed up as a ""conflict of interest"" in corporate terms, which is frowned upon most of the time. And as daring as the main couple would go to lengths to pursue this coveted relationship despite having to keep theirs and their colleagues' mouths shut over this matter, it's a delicate balance just to thrive on something that's a liability to the work they're in. Also, this show is unapologetic in showing the frailty of working adults who have real issues and not just for the sake of shock value and such ""proven"" crap. It's truly a no-nonsense scenario where it's not Masugu and Yui fighting for the relationship to last but also their own careers and work ethics as well to progress together, because after all, since you and your partner are working in different departments of the same company, why not share in close quarters of areas that both of you can hide and confide in your never-ending struggles? It's these kinds of scenarios that anyone would've been blessed, as much as it is a curse, to be in.

While Blade has been working with Silver Link since the COVID years, it's been a while since the studio's very first showing in the form of Fall 2020's Iwa Kakeru! Sport Climbing Girls, though that one was kind of mediocre since the studio was basically unproven at the time (not counting Chinese Manhwa adaptations). Fast forward 4 years, and I'd go as far as to say that Kono Kaisha just looks splendid, even if the animation is barebones at best (which honestly, is needed the least). But it's at least on the spectrum of good, and that's all I need to see for such a work as this.

I did feel that IM.Lab's OST made for the show sometimes feels lacking, but for the most part, it's there, and it's serviceable for the job done. And I don't know if it's just me, but Polkadot Stingray's OP song, while sounding fine, is just forgettable, with its strengths being atmospheric. At least Pachae's ED is better than that, and this is an ED song that is not just groovy but a banger (in terms of wholesome).

Let it be known that if you've been on the watch for office romances with a style that best resembles WotaKoi for the longest time, Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu a.k.a I Have a Crush at Work is your next show to pursue into its world of workplace romance unexplained, but one that'll guarantee you a smile on your face each and every time.",Reviewer’s Rating: 9,https://myanimelist.net/anime/59361/Kono_Kaisha_ni_Suki_na_Hito_ga_Imasu/reviews

Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu,"Everyone keeps secrets, often at work even, but it's rare that your secret is that your dating your so-called office enemy.

In I Have a Crush at Work, we follow Yui and Masugu, who in everyone's eyes are always at each other's throat, fighting over even small disagreements. But in reality the two of them are dating and slowly building a loving relationship, while trying to avoid the possible drama that would come at the office, if their relationship went public.

It is a very down to earth plot, showing normal struggles for a couple that works at the same company. We see how the job can
                  ...
be demanding and stressful, and how a new relationship is full of passion and uncertainty. This gives the show some elements that carry over through the season, while other problems are solved in the episode it shows up in. The show then has a smooth progression, but also doesn’t let a problem hang in the air for too long, while giving the needed details for each plotline. So the plot really shows what an adult life is like, with both job and romance, and is done with a great pace, progression and detail.

The characters are also done with details and clear different personalities. They are made to be normal people, with both flaws and talents, so they have to learn, adapt and compromise. We follow the main couple as they have to learn how to handle some aspects of a relationship and how to deal with situations at work. This gives a nice effect of seeing both the characters individually evolve and their relations evolving with them, which is very satisfying to watch. For the side characters are some of them just there to support the plot and main couple, and thereby doesn’t have much detail to them, while others are shown more attention, becoming a more integral part of the story and has their own progression. The characters overall are done with the right amount of details and individuality, while still keeping their relations realistic, which gives a nice progression for the main couple and certain side characters.

The show is overall very much a down to earth show, which shows aspects of adult life, when it comes to romance and work. It is very enticing to watch, without it being high drama or anything similar. It also keeps a nice balance between art style and the animation, which helps keep the atmosphere of an adult relationship without the high intensive drama, letting the romance be enjoyed by itself.

Honestly, I’ll admit I’m biased because I love this type of show, so if you’re neutral about it, feel free to ignore my opinion.

What I loved most about this series was its beginning, oh my, it was emotional, romantic, and captivating! Even the comedy scenes were so enjoyable, making me get attached to the main couple, Taichi and Yui, of course.

I want to compare it to a very similar series, *Kekkon suru tte, Hontou desu ka* (*365 Days to the Wedding*). Compared to that, this series feels more lively,

If you love romance anime, you should absolutely give this one a try. It’s a unique experience since not many anime focus this much on romance at work in general. I watched it weekly as it aired and had a great time, but I guarantee you’ll enjoy it even more if you binge it. It’s an engaging and entertaining series overall.

The only downside I can think of is how often the story shifts focus away from the romantic relationship. It happens a lot, and that was a bit annoying for me.

and the conflicts are not needlessly drawn out. These don't determine the quality of the show but it's refreshing to see them in an office romance.
The character development is fair, as we witness the growth of the couple both as partners and as individuals, tackling work challenges and personal issues together. The characters for the most part feel relatable, and you can easily empathize with their diverse perspectives.  

As a romance anime, you can't escape some of the classic tropes and clichés. But they don't go too overboard with it, so it's tolerable. Even the supporting characters, while not super developed, are decent enough that they don't drag the show down.  Somei and Hayakawa deserved more screen time!!!

Overall though, this is a really solid, feel-good office romance. If you want something light and wholesome that'll give you the warm fuzzies, definitely check it out! It's way better than a lot of the other workplace romance anime out there.",Reviewer’s Rating: 8,https://myanimelist.net/anime/59361/Kono_Kaisha_ni_Suki_na_Hito_ga_Imasu/reviews
Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu,"Best romance anime of the season, there's no doubt. This anime shows just how much seinen romance is miles ahead of shoujo romance, and I hope this will lead to more seinen romances being adapted in the future.

This is an actual seinen romance with no bullshitting, that might be the best thing about this show. The lack of bullshitting, tropes and fabricated drama makes it really enjoyable and chill. Maybe it's a bit too unproblematic and there's not that much drama, but it doesn't need any of that to stay interesting. It also actually feels like an adult relationship, they actually deal with issues that's
                  ...
realistic both inside and outside their relationship (mostly work related).

The characters are just as charming as the story and the flow of the show. Their relationships and internal conflicts are relatable and done well and it works without the need for (forced) drama. There's a side couple and 2 more coworkers as side characters that get more screen time, besides them there aren't really anyone notable. I think there could've been more but honestly that's all we had time for in 12 episodes, but those 4 side characters are enjoyable to follow when they have their subplot.

There's not much more to say, it's an amazing romance anime that punches above its weight relative to its popularity and budget.",Reviewer’s Rating: 9,https://myanimelist.net/anime/59361/Kono_Kaisha_ni_Suki_na_Hito_ga_Imasu/reviews
Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu,"One of my all-time favourite romance animes. The premise of the show, that of a secret office romance, takes a backseat and instead the show focuses on fleshing out the relationship of the leads.  Both MCs are endearing and given enough characterization that their growing affinity for one another feels completely natural. The office setting isn't just a backdrop for the show to insert genre cliches - the way that Yui and Masugu support one another through the professional hurdles at their workplace makes their compatibility clear as day.  The show blends romantic and workplace drama to great effect - Yui and Masugu
                  ...
display solid individual character growth because they are together. 

The show really succeeds in portraying the excitement of entering a new relationship that has the potential to be serious. There are quite a few genuinely sweet moments that go above and beyond the average anime romance, both in their subtly and their execution. The jokes hit more often than they miss, thanks in part to charming supporting characters. There's also a cute side romance that is done very well . The character designs are appealing and the animation is serviceable, but generally  bright and eye-catching.  The OP and ED are catchy and great tone setters.

Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu,"Underrated anime that will be successful in the future.
Well, I'll tell you why the anime wasn't successful despite being good. First, the anime is very controversial. This anime deals with the reality of a few people in the job market, so many people may find the anime strange, but it's not. Second, our parents taught us not to date at work, which was okay in their time, but in ours, that doesn't work for everyone.
Third reason is that the animation isn't good for a romance anime. The animation is far from being bad, but it's not good for this genre either. I liked the anime

Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu,"I Have a Crush at Work starts off strong with an engaging premise and fast pacing that immediately grabs your attention. The initial episodes feel exciting, as the story moves quickly without dragging. However, this fast pacing also becomes its downfall. While it starts off with enough content to keep viewers hooked, that substance dries up too soon, making the latter half feel somewhat empty and unremarkable.

It’s not a bad watch—you can finish it if you start it—but it doesn’t have anything particularly special to keep you truly invested till the end. It’s more of a casual watch rather than something that leaves a lasting

Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu,"MAL: Comedy, Romance, Adult Cast, Workplace, Seinen. Then maybe something easygoing, and funny, and chillin', right? Well, not really. Or maybe the life of a working adult, right? Again, not really.

The visuals are decent enough, the designs pretty nice. Bright colours, sparkly eyes, all that stuff. Great drawing where is needed, for example when focusing on a cake of something brand-like. Same for landscape.
The audio is ok. It won't bother you, but you won't remark it either. The OP and ED are decent enough, but probably you'll still skip it. The VAs do a decent job, but the show won't use them at their full
                  ...
potential. The production value seems good enough, not over the top.
As you might see, its a ""nice, but"" kinda show. And thats a problem. It gives you a feel for a slice-of-life but at the same time it is not. 

So, the problems. Well, its a show with ""adult cast"" but it doesn't want to go heavily on the ""adult"" stuff. And I don't mean the sex stuff, we have implied scenes for that. I'm talking about the work angle. It should show us a boring slice-of-life day-by-day work stuff, while also their relationship. Nope, we get crisis at work, self imposed problems and such. The show thinks we get to see some personal struggles and character development, but actually we see a nowadays problem: you don't know your characters good enough and you put them in a bad light. For example, she screws something at work, he says some supporting stuff, she decides something, she has a personal growth. What he told her is something along the lines ""you always think too much about what others think"". In other words, this is not the first time happening, she keeps doing the same stuff and she never learned before. And only now, for the viewers, she does better. But that also means that she kept doing the same stuff over and over and over. Its not something major, life changing, but it shows you something about her and that the author never thought things through. There are more examples like these, but it doesn't really matter. My point is the drama is just for show, no real problems. To be fair, there IS some character development, its not all bad, but I was expecting more. My bad :))
  There are a couple of comedy scenes, but those are forced in-between, just to have that comedy tag. Same for the romance. Again, to be fair, you get romance scenes, with nice drawings (sparkles, bubbles, sparking bubbles, blushing) that keep your attention on them, but the motives for those scenes are meh, looks faked, just for our eyes. I mean, its nice and all, but it feels like a plain romance relationship. Yes, we got a couple of nice scenes (both for rom and com) in the first episodes, but thats it, the rest is kinda meh. The selling point of this show was ""(self-imposed) forbidden office romance"". Well, this is not that. And without that, it becomes just a run-of-the-mill rom-com. Thats not a bad thing, but also, not a great thing. It just makes you mediocre, something thats lost in the crowd.

So, a kinda rom-com show, with some kinda character growth, with some decent enough visuals. Stuff happens, stuff gets resolved quickly. Kinda boring after a while. Still not a slice-of-life. And thats it. A jack-of-all-trades means you excel at nothing.

I'll give it a 5, mostly for for the visuals and designs. The show has not ended and I might edit  if needed, but nothing will make it better, so I'm sure the rating will stay the same.

Kono Kaisha ni Suki na Hito ga Imasu,"It's a sickly sweet romance where the twist is a simple one and that is keeping a relationship under wraps at work to ""avoid making things awkward"". A premise which can instigate a vast amount of ideas to work with. Not the most genuine premise ever and it may feel forced or artificial at times, but it does lead to a lot of comedic/romantic moments which is what the audience wants. 

I'm not sure if it's because I'm around the same age group as these fucking goofballs (31 years, married and divorced young, now it's just me and my cows), but watching them go from
                  ...
pure intimacy to unbearably cheesy anime tropes with all the nervous/timid energy to boot, these grown ass adults, is more tiring or unappealing rather than cute/wholesome, which is obviously what they're actually going for with these moments.  

The fact that I can pretty much find every trope/situation this show has to offer in your run of the mill Highschool romance/romcom, doesn't help much either. OK, they're together at the beginning of the show, not a common occurrence in anime, sure, but hardly revolutionary. The sex is a hit with the fans and why wouldn't it be, the vast majority of anime shy away from such affection, but then treating this show like it's the best thing since sliced bread is a little much for me. I will not be swayed by it's variety in development lol, it may even come across as a little cheap writing ploy to draw viewers in right away which will stay for the long run, it's not the only anime that had a sex scene in it's first episode this season (though this one was done far better than the one in Around 40 Otoko no Isekai Tsuuhan, at least it felt organic in this show lol). 

I don't see many others echoing my thoughts on this show in the forum episode threads, sometimes you just want cute and wholesome and I understand that, but the interactions and developments just take me out of it far too often for me to carry on with the show.

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"100 Girlfriends Who REALLY Love You - This is it; we've officially hit PEAK Trash Harem Rom-com, the likes of which we have not seen since time millenia, in the most flawless and outlandish way ever done possible.

For all of what the AniManga industry has to offer since its humble beginnings decades ago, only one genre stands out the most due to its consistent relevancy: the romance genre, which comes in a lot of flavours for everyone's enjoyment. And seemingly, one of the most popular themes from that genre would come to define the next level of enjoyment: harem. Sure, you have the obvious ones,
                  ...
like Ken Akamatsu's Negima! Magister Negi Magi series, which has a child MC being loved by his class of 31 high school girls, is, to my mind, the very first incarnation of the ""more than single-digit"" harem rom-com series.

And while no other series would beat the famed mangaka's work in time to come (if focusing on just that aspect), it would take almost 8 years for the next rival to show up, and I don't know how this author came up with the absurd concept, but it has earned its fanbase overtime to become one of the most vocal communities whenever a new rival...erm, girlfriend shows up to add to the total number. And that, my friends, is mangaka Rikito Nakamura and illustrator Yukiko Nozawa's Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo a.k.a The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, REALLY Love You, one of the most unapologetic AniManga works to come out in a very long while, came out guns blazing to give everyone a dose of its voraciously irresistible over-the-top harem medicine with the ever-so-loving parody twist that leaves us drugged and intoxicated for more.

Just a short story between the two mangaka that made something that has since been the eye-opener for the manga readers anticipating the long-awaited and much-hyped anime adaptation: both Rikito Nakamura and Yukiko Nozawa already had works to their name, the former starting out in 2016 and the latter starting out in 2013. But for the par of their course, none of them really panned out, with Rikito Nakamura having his own absurd ideas that just cannot be translated into full series (the best (unknown) was 2017's Heppoko Yuusha ni Senryaku wo a.k.a Please Give Strategies to Immature Hero) and Yukiko Nozawa already having her debut of 2013's Eguchi-kun manga series to lukewarm reviews. Clearly, something, somewhere, must be missing, and it would not be until the latter's single manga volume of 2016's Henshoku Joshi wa Koi de Onaka wo Mitashitai that she would experience the turning point of her life, plus another 3 years for the former to once again create a manga series of his choosing. This then brings us to both author and illustrator joining hands for 100 Girlfriends a.k.a HyaKkano, where within the span of 4 years (plus the anime adaptation into account) since the manga's release in December 2019, has seen an exponential explosion in its loyal fanbase, cementing that the series IS the next step in the harem rom-com evolution of being not just the first ""triple digit"" harem rom-com series, but a manga series that would stand the test of time to come. And what a manga it is that we still have Season 2 of the anime to go, which speaks to the testament of the fantastic adaptation that we received here.

Going into HyaKkano, the only thing that you need to take note of: despite being a typical harem rom-com, this show is NOT meant to be taken seriously, since it's a parody of said genres that bends its rules to the limit so outrageously and dim-wittedly that it corners itself into masterpiece territory. The idea of someone being rejected — that's normal, but 100 times? The God of Love sure is unruly with this boy named Rentarou Aijo. Every high school boy and girl wants to achieve their romantic soulmate, and Rentarou is no different, being a failed chad MC that has gotten 100 rejections in a row without any of the stupid anime shenanigan requirements like the usual cultural festival and shitz. Determined to change his life for the better, he visits the shrine that would help turn his situation around, and the God of Love literally visits him and grants his wish. The problem: due to the God of Love breaking the 4th wall, he made a mistake by not blessing him with a girlfriend of his dreams but with 100 girlfriends instead. However, this comes with a very simple caveat: get rejected by at least one of them, and their lives are marked for death, plain and simple. Therein starts Rentaro's self-improving project of keeping his ""Rentaro (harem) family"" together, despite all circumstances.

From here on, let's get introduced to the first few girlfriends attached to Rentaro for Season 1 of the anime:
- Girlfriends No. 1 and 2: the Deredere of Hakari Hanazono and the Tsundere of Karane Inda. Both girls are the aforementioned same-class classmates together with Rentaro, and these two girls will give you an idea of how unhinged the ""assumed"" two-timing relationship will go. Hakari is the rich man's girl of the group, but her personality is an entire 180° flip of a switch that she can become obsessive about Rentaro's advances, always in gleam of whatever he does to keep the relationship alive. But for Karane, she opposes the very idea that Rentaro is going for, despite not knowing the dire consequences that said chad MC would not do her so; she just went with it and warmed up to him overtime to accept that the nth-timing is a way that he can establish his ""army"" of girlfriends, despite her slim figure that hides a gargantuan gorilla-ish high strength.
- Girlfriend No. 3: the Dandere of Shizuka Yoshimoto. She's another classmate of the trio, but someone who always hides away in their school's library club is a librarian. Being someone of few words, Rentaro's trouble dealing with her comes with its own set of difficulties that honestly is a cinch. But being a bookworm and someone who loves to read fantasy romance stories allows Rentaro to connect better with her, to the point of developing a specific app to relay her replies to anyone. The level of dedication to this quiet girl is one reason why he's the ultimate harem chad.
- Girlfriend No. 4: the Kuudere of Nano Eiai. Think of her as like Komi-san wa, Comyushou desu. a.k.a Komi Can't Communicate's titular female MC character is the epitome of stoic emotionlessness that doesn't hide her spectacular levels of intelligence and high optimization of her daily life to remove all unnecessary clutter. Yet, in the eyes of Rentaro (like Komi-san's titular male MC Hitohito Tadano), she begins to feel emotions that she would not have otherwise felt, and over time, she begins to accept that Rentaro will always be a part of her life.
- Girlfriend No. 5: the Undere of Kusuri Yakuzen. The 3rd-year president of the Chemistry Club, her speciality is creating drugs that have 1001 ways of emitting strange effects, often being the boon and bane of Rentaro and his girlfriends when situations are called to the crunch. That said, Kusuri's biggest twist is that one of her drugs, the immortal drug, allows her to swap into the body of an 18-year-old girl but will always retract back to the 8-year-old body, which doesn't discount her young adult mentality. She's kind of like an oddball, working for the best of circumstances.
- Girlfriend No. 6: the Himidere of Hahari Hanazono. As you can tell by the family name, she is Hakari's mother, and her family history is one of distraught, where, in the simplest of terms, she raised Hakari as a single mother, having dated someone who was terminally ill from a very young age that he died a young child. She's hands down the biggest troublemaker when it comes to the Rentaro family; she stands her ground from the simple fact that it's immoral for Rentaro to nth-time her only daughter, which by hook or by crook, the chad MC managed to cure her heart, and that's how she got into the harem craze.

There are still more girlfriends to come, so this is just the start! And no, don't get me started on the kiss-thirsty vice principal of the school; she MUST be tied down like a snake.

I'm very impressed by the anime adaptation we got here, which manages to outdo the manga and amp it up to 11. This is much thanks to director Hikaru Sato, who is the director for the batshit-insane Jashin-chan Dropkick series. So for anyone who has seen an episode or two of that show, you'll know what to expect: absurd, ballsy, walls-over-the-top double-trouble of a show. Just like with Jashin-chan, he absolutely honoured the nonsensical parallels of the manga that's translated to the anime, and his staff team, for better or for worse, absolutely nailed the adaptation right down to a T. I have no words but endless praise for Hikaru Sato for a marvellous job done. And at first, I thought I was worried about the studio adapting this, considering that it's Bibury Animation Studios with their wide catalogue of shows with lots of variety. But my fears (as well as those ofanga readers) are soon allayed because the anime adaptation is, simply put, outstanding.

The OST is another highlight for the series as well. I often always deride songs sung by character VAs, but this one is just the right measure of vibes, and this is a great song. Even better, is Nako Misaki's ED, which is low-key certified, a bopping banger.

You don't need me to say that 100 Girlfriends a.k.a HyaKkano has been one of the most-awaited manga-turned-anime adaptations from source readers for quite some time, that with the anime, the manga has been done justice, and furthermore,.

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"From the world renowned Anime Harem Academy, popularly known as ""AHA!!!"" which produced such graduates as farmer extraordinaire Hiraku Michio, last male standing Mizuhara Reito, the god of negation Touma Kamijou, reincarnated magnetism Kazuto Hongou, shady teacher magister Negi Springfield, god of conquest Katsuragi Keima, Oppai Dragon emperor Hyoudou Issei, your neighborhood friendly spirit whisperer Shido Itsuka and many many more, comes the newest and freshest able bodied graduate Aijo Rentaro, fated to be courted by a hundred ladies of myriad shapes, ages, features and personalities.

Plot: The title is the plot of this Anime appropriately summarised as briefly as possible. Now if you thought that
                  ...
was hilarious, you're in for a treat from the very onset of this one. From divine mistakes to mistakes of divine proportions, this is a ridiculous ride of fun and funny with occasional flourishes of light dramatic moments. 

Characters: The protagonist at the beginning is someone who just can not catch a break, so much so he ends up scoring the unholy, unwanted, unrequited century. Though unlike most other Harem protagonists, he is neither as dense as a black hole, nor as dumb as the asteroid that was a bit rude to the Jurassic inhabitants. 

And then there is the Harem, which if anything plays about every single archetype in the book. Almost every kind of trope is on show as well. Not to forget the Gods either, they play a key role often in the story, as well as the students and inhabitants of the locality.

Animation: This is not the Anime for Sakuga connoisseurs. However, here you'll be amply entertained with gag and humour animation as much as you want. It is filled to the brim with low effort meme faces, random allusions, and myriad references. This sort of style suits what Hundred Girlfriends is really well, and you'll be hard pressed to find someone who finds it difficult to palate. 

Music: Again, the music mostly blends well with what is shown on screen. There is nothing much to talk about it, the music does it's job and enhances the effect other things have. 

Enjoyment: Quite honestly, The Hundred Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You is perhaps the most funny and humorous Anime of this season. You'd have to try really hard and possess a special amount of obnoxious pretentiousness to not find enough here to entertain you. This comes with a glowing recommendation as a certified laugh fest, have fun while it is here to entertain you.",Reviewer’s Rating: 8,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54714/Kimi_no_Koto_ga_Daidaidaidaidaisuki_na_100-nin_no_Kanojo/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/59457/Haite_Kudasai_Takamine-san/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/52709/Danjo_no_Yuujou_wa_Seiritsu_suru_Iya_Shinai/reviews
Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"One thing is clear after watching this entire season, and it's that there are people out there who have no idea what love actually is. The question becomes, then, whether those people are the writers, the target audience, or both.

When you start a show with ""100 Girlfriends"" in the title, you have already accepted the ridiculousness of the premise and can't really complain about the absurdity of the plot. That being said, I still feel like there were two acceptable paths through a show like this: you either give us paper-thin characters so we can quickly collect all 100 and choose our favorite like we
                  ...
did with Pokemon, or you stick with a small number and develop them into living, breathing characters. Sadly for ""100 Girlfriends,"" however, we get the worst of both worlds.

By the end of Season 1, the number of titular girlfriends is still in the single-digits, yet none of them are developed beyond their singular defining trait. We get the thirsty one, the angry one, the quiet one, and the emotionless one, just to name a few, but we have zero reason to love these girls because we really don't know why the MC loves them in the first place. The ""love"" he feels for them is the equivalent of the Zing from Hotel Transylvania, and both he and the girlfriends know that they (literally) cannot live without one another, but aside from that? He never once gives us a reason for his attraction aside from the fact that he's a high school boy with a harem.

This circles back to my opening remark, which was meant as a legitimate criticism of the writing and not an insult to the people that enjoyed the show. Why should I care what happens to any of these people if the MC that ""loves"" them cannot articulate why he himself cares? There's an arc near the end that is meant to create prisonbreak-style drama, but when the prisoner in question is essentially a plot device, I feel like I'm the one in need of an escape route. The VA cast, animation, and music were all on-point, hence why I can't give this less than a 4/10, but I can't honestly go any higher when the plot falls so flat. All would be forgiven if the comedy was there, but alas, none of that landed for me either.

In short, this show was quite disappointing. I love the harem genre because it gives the viewer an opportunity to argue with friends about which girl is best, but there's just not enough here to make those arguments worthwhile. I honestly do not think I could recommend this show to anyone because it falls so short of expectations in every important category.",Reviewer’s Rating: 4,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54714/Kimi_no_Koto_ga_Daidaidaidaidaisuki_na_100-nin_no_Kanojo/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/59457/Haite_Kudasai_Takamine-san/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/52709/Danjo_no_Yuujou_wa_Seiritsu_suru_Iya_Shinai/reviews

The anime's structure so far is quite consistent, with each girl's character arc lasting one episode, with some episodes in between. This is not unique within the harem genre, with other titles such as ""The world god only knows"" experimenting with this episodic story structure. 

While this does exemplify each girl's personality, the anime excels in both its ""storytelling"", rapid fire jokes based on parodying character tropes and genre tropes comedy in episodes not focusing on a singular character. In these episodes, each character is exaggerated to a ridiculous extent, allowing their personalities to bounce off each other and create whimsical scenes and one-liners. 

Each character is designed specifically to exemplify their personalities to a ridiculous extent, with the most obvious example being Karane, who is so ""tsundere"" that she would hurt Rentarou every time she is hurt or embarrassed, throwing punches like a pro WWE fighter and ardently denying whatever he says while blushing stupidly. This does a great job in creating many jokes revolving around these personality tropes, with the girls often during ridiculous things based on their personality type, making excellent comedy for the show.

The sound quality is impressive, both in the voice acting and music department. The opening is upbeat, whimsical and catchy, which fits right in with the show's vibe. The voice acting is done by many experienced voice actors who do a great job delivering the jokes.

Negative aspects:
In a show so focused on paraodying the harem genre and making multiple rapid-fire jokes, the episode arc regarding Shizuka is rather disappointing being much more serious and dramatic. While her backstory and character is somewhat interesting, it is not that deep or memorable and is quite jarring considering the whimisical and light tone of the anime thus far. 

The show is not very deep, with each character being almost entirely made up of their surface level personality, and the main character being very typical, being just a vessel for jokes. This is not necessarily a bad thing for a slapstick/ parody style show, but prevents you from getting fully invested.

Overall, this a fun show to put on every week for a few laughs and it has managed to keep its jokes and punchlines fresh and engaging. While not the comedic masterpiece some tout it to be, it certainly is worth a try for those who are into the romance genre, or those who are tired of the hundreds of tropey romance anime and wish for something a bit fresh.",Reviewer’s Rating: 7,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54714/Kimi_no_Koto_ga_Daidaidaidaidaisuki_na_100-nin_no_Kanojo/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/59457/Haite_Kudasai_Takamine-san/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/52709/Danjo_no_Yuujou_wa_Seiritsu_suru_Iya_Shinai/reviews
Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"Here it is—the ultimate harem anime that fans like ""us"" have been eagerly anticipating. If you've ever encountered an ""author's wet dream"" anime, this one ranks among the wettest of them all.

If you think an MC with three or four girls craving his presence is already living the dream, well, this mfers has five with 95 more on the way. And you know what's even better? This fellow definitely deserves it all. Imagine getting rejected 100 times while still in your first year of high school. It's physically impossible, but he did it anyway and tanked it all like a champ. It's all worth it
                  ...
in the end.

Not only does this anime feature a guy getting rejected, a guy getting a girlfriend, but also a tsundere confessing her love in the first episode—THE FIRST FCKING EPISODE! Tell me how many anime pull that off in the first episode.

The animation is eye-pleasing, bright, with amazing expressions. The way the animators drew their blushing faces is a work of art.

The opening song is probably one of the best harem openings I've ever heard. It's catchy, addicting, and paired with adorable and cute lyrics, it's a chef's kiss.

Keep in mind that this anime is definitely not for everyone. It's not an anime that emit hype with crazy fight scenes or anime that boast a thick plotline that might get a Hollywood live-action. This is the type of anime you watch with your brain turned off, just enjoying the cuteness and cuddliness of it while constantly banging your head against the wall, screaming, ""It should've been me.""",Reviewer’s Rating: 9,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54714/Kimi_no_Koto_ga_Daidaidaidaidaisuki_na_100-nin_no_Kanojo/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/59457/Haite_Kudasai_Takamine-san/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/52709/Danjo_no_Yuujou_wa_Seiritsu_suru_Iya_Shinai/reviews

In conclusion, this anime is just a pure joy to watch. It got all the right thing going for it with good directing, animation, and sound direction.

Full review:
First of all, please don't be taken away much by the name and gimmick of this anime. While it look quite excessive and interesting, it will only be just that. The real anime doesn't play into the 100gf gimmick that much. However, they took advantage of the number and present us with as numerous creative character as possible, with some good writing too might I add. They somehow don't overlook any character in playing a role in an action on the screen (a thing you would assuming with the amount of character), which is very impressive and show such creativity.  
[Story 8/10, Character 9/10]

However, the REAL thing that's really holding up the anime and pushing the creative boundaries of anime is its comedy. This anime got one of the BEST creative comedy ever in all of anime (if comparing, this would be on Bochi the rock & Kaguya sama love is war level, but all are in the same degree just different style). It have some good but not too much of comedy referencing real world things, just the right amount. All blend together with the beautiful and unique animation and sound design creativity that bring these to life in the most beautiful and perfect way.  + It doesn't get repetitive at all, always finding a new joke/things to play around while also interacting with the environment & situation at hand.

It really brings me back to the old days where harem romcoms were as popular as ""Isekai"" anime. Which is refreshing because there is always a looming thought and opinion on which girl is best girl. In this case, every girl is best girl in this anime. There's a flavor for everyone so no one can complain about which girl is best suited for the MC since he's going to be with all of them regardless. It truly is the GOAT of Harem romcoms.

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"“The gigachad among gigachads!”

Rentarou Aijou, the main character of The 100 Girlfiends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You, is undoubtedly the gigachad among gigachads.

I started reading the manga 100 Girlfriends last year 2022 and admitted that it was my favorite harem manga at all time. Then I prayed that there would be an anime version. And my dream finally came true. The 100 Girlfriends Anime is here.

In the story, it’s about a boy name Rentarou Aijou who was rejected 100 times. He prayed in the shrine that he would have a girlfriend. To his surprise, Kami-sama appeared in front of him.

Just like in
                  ...
manga, there was also 'breaking the 4th wall' and even parody. Yes! The 100 Girlfriends Who Really5x Love You isn't only romcom and harem, but also parody.

You may think Rentarou is a womanizer, but you can't blame him for having 100 girlfriends. It was Kami-sama's fault for making the biggest mistake for the rest of his life.

Besides, Rentarou tries his best to make his girlfriends happy and get along together. More importantly, he can't reject the girls, or else they will die.

Speaking of girlfriends, there are different girlfriend-types for him. I mean, really different, like perverted-type, tsundere-type, quiet-type, kuudere-type, scientist-type, and so on.

Anyway, trust me, everyone. Rentarou Aijou is the best boy. And again, he is the gigachad among gigachads. Also, the visual (animation) and the sound (opening and ending theme songs) are absolutely amazing.

From the marketing on social media to the PVs, and the music and the episodes themselves, it was so clear that the whole team was so dedicated to making this a work of art that I will NEVER hate again on this studio. Everything is so well done, from the voice acting, to the art direction, and the sound quality, that each new episode managed to get me through the miserable slog that is college with a smile and hopes of a new episode every week. I never ONCE doubted Bibury's ability to concoct and cook after the first episode aired. Marcos Pierre White's cooking talents PALES to Bibury's masterpiece with 100 girlfriends.

Obviously you can not like the story. It isn't for everyone, nor the genre for that matter. I will not blame you if you didn't like the story and that turned you off a bit, but I implore you to read the manga, which I can confidently say is PEAK MEDIA. The anime does do it justice and the loveable cast of characters being adapted for season 2 make me even more excited to see what this excellent team of VAs and adaption team have in store.

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"This anime is one of the very few anime with a real harem theme. where, in almost all anime with a harem theme, it doesn't really feel like a real harem. even though the concept is very ordinary, like romance anime in general, namely in high school. Even so, the way the concept is presented is extraordinarily good, and there is real intention in presenting it.
 
The main character in this anime responds quickly to what the heroines do. He has qualities that feel real, like most high school boys in the real world. This is also a very important point in romantic anime because almost
                  ...
all romantic anime with a high school concept show the character of the protagonist, which feels strange and not very real. And what needs to be emphasized is that what he is getting now is a gift because of his sad past with many rejections. Don't forget that the heroine characters in this anime are also fun and feel natural in their personalities without forcing it in their presentation.
 
So far, I really enjoy this anime; it's full of comedy, and of course, the harem theme really feels real. When I was in high school, I was popular among girls and dated all of them, and they were all popular girls too, although not as extreme as Rentaro compared to my previous situation.

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"There are two requirements you have to fulfill to understand why I rated this show so highly. 1: You have to have seen a lot of anime romcoms to accustom yourself to anime cringe and be able to tolerate it. 2: You have to know and except that anime romcoms are complete fucking garbage. Once you recognize the inherent flaws of that genre of that medium, you realize that this anime, knows exactly what it’s doing and that it is one of the greatest pieces of satire I have ever seen. It’s so good that many dumbasses don’t even realize that they’re being made fun
                  ...
of and take it seriously. This shit is so dumb, so fucking incomprehensibly retarded, that it is one of the most ingenious romcoms I have watched. This makes fun of everything that is harem anime. Like the whole reason harem anime’s exist is because they’re the power fantasies of romance. Like, because I’m a good guy all these girls should fall in love with me. It’s inherently misogynistic and lazy and it is based around the ideology of the “nice guy” which is an issue in it’s own way. And the worst part is how these harem shows justify the harem: they either just lead everyone on without creating boundaries, which is very harmful and manipulative. They’re dense and don’t realize they have a harem which is frustrating and a lazy way to cop out. Or they do the whole “I’ll make everyone happy”, which is probably the worst among them. This show on the other hand takes the idea of a harem and shits on it, giving the best explanation to why it’s there: Because God himself decreed it, making it so if they don’t get with you, you die. That is fucking hilarious and is a genius way to make us root for the harem without supporting all of the harmful and cringy justifications other harem plots generate. It’s literally God himself made a mistake forcing these girls to fall in love and forcing their hand to cause a harem. This is satire because it is the only reasonable and justifiable explanation for this shit: act of God. I mean it was a mistake but that doesn’t change the fact. And what’s really genius about it is that the way they explain it, with the whole ‘soulmate’ thing, makes it so it doesn’t feel like the girls are forced to fall in love (though they technically are) because they choose to stay on their own volition. This makes the whole situation feel less disgusting and give us room to get invested. Now I will admit, that part kind of goes against my previous praises. The main character knows that if they leave him they die, but the girls don’t, and while that makes it so they aren’t threatened to stay, you then have the justification of why they do, which isn’t handled well. I just chalked this up the the forceful nature of the soulmate gimmick but either way this is the inherent issue with a harem and they couldn’t really find a way around it. There is no reason the girls should stay in that kind of relationship. This of course means that the main character has to be the “I’ll make everyone happy” but because of the divine meddling, it feels more of a inevitable behavior than it does deceitful misogyny. Moving on from that, the satire doesn’t stop there. They take all the different ‘dere’s which are lazy ways to avoid making complex characters, and take it up to 11. None of these girls have much going for them character-wise, but that’s intentional. They play into their archetypes to show the ridiculousness of them by making them incomprehensibly stupid. You want the serious mature girl who thinks love is pointless? Here’s a super computer. All of this genius I’m talking about is hidden under a pile of the most retarded shit you can imagine. They take all of the already ridiculous cringefest of harem romcoms and play them up so much that it wraps back around to being good. I mean just the premise of the show is an example of this. All of these guys in these animes get half the school to fall in love with them and it’s ridiculous. So this show sees that and says, fuck it, watch this asshole, this guy’s going to get 100 girlfriends. It’s over-the-top and stupid. All of the drama is played out in situations so stupid that you know they aren’t taking it seriously. This show is just taking the stupid elements of romcoms and harems and taking them in the most stupid direction possible to show their shortcomings. And it’s hilarious. Now the actual quiet moments where the drama is addressed are still boring and cringy but they are kind of necessary to hold the story together. I’m also not a big fan of 4th wall breaks which is why I gave up on the manga. Overall some of the shitty elements of romcom animes do slip there way into this show without being meddled with, but the attempt at satire is still hilarious and well appreciated. Or maybe this show is just retarded and I’m reading too much into it. Either way it’s a blast.

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"Alright, let's dive into the absolute madness that is ""Kimi no Koto ga Dai Dai Dai Dai Daisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo""! I mean, seriously, who needs a hundred girlfriends? That's just pure, unadulterated chaos. But, come on, this is the world of manga and anime – a place where societal norms go to die. Hell, we've had reincarnations into swords, vending machines, and even pigs. Jesus Christ I mean, pigs! And don't get me started on ""My Life as Inukai-san's Dog."" Wow, wtf was that all about, Itsutsuse you damn degenerate? And wth is Truck-kun playing at, out there wildin on incels, why can't
                  ...
he be running over doctors and astronauts, for crying out loud!

Now, before you grab your pitchforks and tell me that ""Inukai-san's Dog"" isn't an isekai, and that's not what we're here to discuss today. What I'm getting at is that these stories share a common theme: they're all outrageously outlandish and unapologetically unapologetic. And, you know what? That's precisely why, despite knowing there are better shows out there, we can't resist hitting that ""next episode"" button. It's like a post-nut feeling – it terrifies me! It’s a terribly vicious cycle.

Honestly I kinda hate how they cracked my code man, I keep on getting finessed into watching these kinda shows, but you know what? Some of these shows are surprisingly decent, and ""Kimi no Koto ga Dai Dai Dai Dai Daisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo"" is one of them.

At first, I thought a story with a hundred girls was bound to be a train wreck. How could you possibly navigate relationships with that many people? It's unsustainable! And that temple ojisan warning that if he fails to connect with even one soulmate, they'll all croak or some ish like that? No way this could work! It's not even something a hikikomori's wildest wet dreams could top, and there's already talk of an adaptation. So, I had to dive in and see what this chaos was all about.

The first two episodes introduce Rentarou, a guy who's been rejected by a hundred girls, starting at the ripe old age of 8 months (Yeah! Me too its shocking). The temple ojisan shows up and reveals that he has 100 soulmates thanks to a little divine mistake. So far, we've met Hakari Hanazono, the cheerful yandere with a supposed monopoly on the world's thighs, and Karane Inda, the tsundere who's clearly simping for Rentarou but won't admit it. We watch as Rentarou tries to balance his relationships with these two, all while avoiding their jealous rivals and potential accidents. And guess what? Two episodes in, and it's already chaotic, with 98 more soulmates to go. Hold on tight! Oh and by the way before we butt heads about this, best girl goes to the vice principal, I will not hear it! no one is topping that tongue work it's not happening.

On the visual side of things, the animation is top-notch, vibrant, and colourful. Character designs are expressive, and the movements are fluid. The voice acting is fantastic, with each actor capturing their character's personality and emotions flawlessly. The music is catchy, with a bop of an opening song and an adorable ending tune. The comedy is fast-paced and side-splitting, poking fun at harem genre tropes left and right. And the romance is sweet and genuine, with each girl sharing a unique connection and chemistry with Rentarou.

There is nothing I would love more than to say it's done, now run along you little weebos, go dive head first into watching this anime, No! I know better, I still have scars from past experiences, rather what I will do is prescribe a healthy dose of caution. Yes the majority of the things mentioned in this review have been mostly positive, but it's only been two episodes, I have brothers, sisters and some closeted furry cousins who got baited by the notorious ""false start"", it’s a terrible thing, just ask ""The Seven Deadly Sins"" fandom, some of them even suffered the great injustice of finishing the dreaded season three, omg! I am tearing up, it’s a horrible fate.

But there is hope still, fear not, for from what I've seen so far, ""Kimi no Koto ga Dai Dai Dai Dai Daisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo"" seems like a wild, enjoyable ride for fans of harem romantic comedies. It's got a unique and creative premise, a diverse and likable cast of characters, a humorous plot, and top-notch production values. If you're into comedy, romance, or harems, give this one a try. It's 100 times the fun! Hehe🐖🔥.

As dumb as it sounds, it hooks you. Not just for the girls, nor the humor but also finding out what excuses he weaves up to date 100 girls simultaneously.

It's so hilariously idiotic but in the best possible way. It's also refreshing that the MC actually has a brain and normal human decency, so he treats the female characters with respect and doesn't faint at the mere touch of a woman as they tend to be in romcoms. ( Looking at you Kazuya from Rent a Girlfriend). The anime is cheesy, it has all the tropes you could imagine and it’s completely over-the-top. But what allows it to work is exactly the fact that this show does not take itself serious. It’s a parody of itself, but still retains a somewhat coherent plot. Towards the end of the season, it even tackles more serious topics such as losing loved ones or suicide. And it gently shifts comedy a bit to the side. The first part of the season relied heavily on comedy, but the second part of the season dives more into the connection between the characters and allowing character development to occur. This anime ended up completely defying my expectations because it is unlike anything I have ever watched. And I must admit that I was very entertained.

Let's be perfectly clear: this anime doesn't deliver any remarkable storytelling or anything of that sort. The animation is decent, and there's plenty of ecchi and fan service. But honestly, I was thoroughly entertained and laughed tons throughout the first half of the season, which already made it worth watching for me. This is a fun watch for in between and I can only recommend it, because it is exactly what you would think it is based on the title. It even has organic, romantic moments which end up being wholesome and do not overstay their welcome, which was also a pleasant surprise.  

Just sit back, relax, switch off your brain, and enjoy this romantic comedy taken to its absolute extreme which actually ends up working, somehow...",Reviewer’s Rating: 8,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54714/Kimi_no_Koto_ga_Daidaidaidaidaisuki_na_100-nin_no_Kanojo/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/59457/Haite_Kudasai_Takamine-san/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/52709/Danjo_no_Yuujou_wa_Seiritsu_suru_Iya_Shinai/reviews

Im not going to take mutch of your time. This is a PARODY of a lot of animes tropes and characters archetype, and i Love all The references.

Its a harem but first it is a ecchi comedy. You Will watch it to have a good time and fun, but never seek for real romance here, besides The ""romance"" tag. The Girls are cool and you really want to date them, but they easly accept dating MC with a lot of other Girls, what males them... Kinda dum dum, but still enjoyable from comedy perspective.

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"I'll admit, I was hesitant to dive into this anime. Harem shows aren't usually my cup of tea, but The 100 Girlfriends anime blew me away!

Rentarou's story hooked me from the start. The poor guy's been rejected 100 times, and his luck changes when the god of the matchmaking shrine foretells he'll meet 100 soulmates in high school.

What I loved most was how the girls didn't become rivals; instead, they formed genuine bonds with each other, accepting and supporting one another.

The characters are incredibly well-developed and mature. Rentarou's exceptional qualities make him worthy of their affection, and I appreciated how he cared for each girl
                  ...
equally. No favoritism or shallow relationships here!

My favorite? That's tough! All the girls are adorable, but Shizuka stole my heart. Her shyness, petite size, and reliance on books to communicate made her irresistibly cute.

What worked:

- Unique take on the harem genre
- Well-developed, relatable characters
- Refreshing focus on friendship and mutual respect among the girls
- Rentarou's exceptional qualities make him a believable ""harem king""

What didn't:

- Supporting characters deserved more screen time

Overall, ""The 100 Girlfriends"" surprised me with its thoughtful storytelling, lovable characters, and healthy relationships. If you're looking for a harem anime that defies expectations, give this a try!

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"While The 100 Girlfriends is often praised for being a parody of the harem genre, I personally found it to be an incredibly overrated series that leans far too heavily on the very tropes it’s supposedly satirizing. The premise alone—a guy is fated to fall in love with 100 girls or they'll die—is absurd, and while that could’ve led to some clever meta-humor or commentary on the genre, the execution falls flat. It ends up feeling more like a flashy gimmick designed to get attention rather than a meaningful twist on romcom or harem conventions.

The tone of the show reeks of that “hyper-kawaii"" weeb-bait aesthetic
                  ...
that reminds me of anime culture/fans in the 2017-COVID era: loud, overly sugary, and trying way too hard to be cute or quirky without much substance. It’s the kind of show to made to flood youtube feeds of ""cute compilations"" of anime, as well as get people to be like ""___ best girl"" ""___ supremacy"" and cringeworthy things like that.

While I get that the show is meant to be self-aware, that self-awareness doesn't necessarily excuse the lazy writing or recycled tropes. For example, one of the most braindead scenes happens in episode 2 alone: Karane (The first introduced love interest along with Hakari, and the show's poster tsundere) is blindfolded during a school test of courage, and a cat accidentally brushes against her inner thigh. She instantly assumes the protagonist, Rentarou, touched her and beats the hell out of him. It's not funny AT ALL. it’s a textbook misunderstanding trope used for cheap laughs and fanservice, and from that scene alone, I could tell the show would be hardcapped at a 6 at best.

Speaking of Karane: she's often hailed as a fan-favorite, but I just do not like her her. That might partially be due to my general dislike for tsundere characters, especially those who rely on violent slapstick and possess little emotional depth early on. I will admit, her backstory involving her tsundere family was genuinely funny and at least tried to add some character depth, and she can be cute at times when the show pretty much devolves into post-irony.

I also really disliked Hakari. She's the ""flirty airhead"" archetype, constantly trying to act seductive but with zero depth behind her behavior. Her one-note obsession with being lewd comes off as annoying rather than endearing, especially since Rentarou is too terrified or spineless to respond to any of the girls’ advances. (I fucking HATE hate these type of characters. Just wait until I get to you Rito.)  It turns into a frustrating loop: the girls keep throwing themselves at him, Rentarou freaks out or shuts down, rinse and repeat. It’s hard to enjoy scenes that are meant to be romantic or sexy when the guy looks like he’s one sneeze away from having a panic attack.

Which brings me to another big issue: the dynamic between Rentarou and the girls. They’re constantly trying to get lewd with him, pushing him into sexually charged situations, while he’s too scared or flustered to do anything. This makes their interactions feel forced, repetitive, and weirdly one-sided. It’s hard to buy into any actual romantic development when everything is just lewd gags with zero intimacy or sincerity.

When it comes to the humor in general, I feel like the self-awareness just gets to a point of it trying too hard, and it almost feels like 2nd hand embarrassment at times.

That being said, I won’t claim that the series is abysmal, It is decent by harem standards, and there were definitely moments that genuinely got a laugh out of me. I also appreciate how the protagonist Rentarou actually tries to be emotionally honest and open with the girls, which is refreshing for the genre. But beyond that, I couldn’t find much to hold onto. It felt like another cashgrab romcom with a ""parody"" label slapped on as a defense mechanism.",Reviewer’s Rating: 3,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54714/Kimi_no_Koto_ga_Daidaidaidaidaisuki_na_100-nin_no_Kanojo/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/59457/Haite_Kudasai_Takamine-san/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/52709/Danjo_no_Yuujou_wa_Seiritsu_suru_Iya_Shinai/reviews
Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"When your genre is oversaturated with boring, repetitive trash that only exists to please the lowest common denominator, you can take one of two routes.
The Re:Zero route, where you revolutionise the genre with a fresh concept and a well written story to give a nice breath of fresh air from the mundanity.
Or you can go the Konosuba route. Double, triple, quadruple down. Beat the others by doing what they do Ad Absurdum.

most extreme. And it so much fun because of it.

Bored of girls fighting over one guy? Well, what if that guy gains so many girlfriends so fast that they just roll with it. Sick of a cast of three or four girls with paper-thin personalities? Well we're on the road to 100, all of whom get their time in the limelight to develop and grow as characters. Tired of protagonists that are as interesting a blank slate and grate on you like being dragged through the desert? Let me introduce you to Aijou Rentarou, the man so obsessed with love and affection that he manages to maintain multiple relationships at a time, all of whom know about each other, without ever letting a single one of them down.

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"As a huge fan of the manga this adaption is all I could've asked for and more. The studio did a great job adapting the art style and giving us all the cute shots from the manga. The additions they made through both the animation and music/VAs gave even someone like me who knew what was going to happen something to look forward to. The Kissing Zombies episode especially stood out as making the kissing scenes feel much more intense and intimate through the vibe of the music. I also loved seeing all the blushes and ""hnngs"" animated. All the VAs did a great job
                  ...
with their characters, each one really fit well which I think is very important for a show so reliant on liking all the characters. 

I truly do think this is peak ""Romcom"" in the literal sense of the word. We have the maximum ""Rom"" in the sense that there's an ever expanding cast of new love interests, but also with the way both Rentarou and all the girlfriends express their love. Rentarou is in to the maximum for being in love and doing everything he can for everyone he loves. As for the ""Com"" aspect I also think this series is extraordinarily funny especially later on. The original author does a really great job with snappy punchlines and visual gags that the anime does a decent job adapting. The anime is not quite as funny as the manga (especially not yet), but it still does a good job. This part of the story is probably one of the most ""serious"" sections of the story with things like Rentarou's first decision between Karane and Hakari, Shizuka's backstory, Nano's first date, and everything with Hahari, but it still manages to weave lighthearted and funny stuff throughout despite that.

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"Let me start by saying that this anime is simply an absurd genius but let's put the reason into context
THIS REVIEW CONTAINS NO SPOILERS!

STORY
We have a guy who has (or rather will have) 100 girlfriends and okay you might think...ah here's the usual harem story
And in fact at the beginning I thought it was like that and I didn't even want to start it
But I have to say that I had to completely change my mind
Rentaro YOU ​​MUST HAVE 100 GIRLS and that's because it's totally contextualized (I won't give any spoilers about it because I really recommend seeing it to find out)

CHARACTERS
The protagonist makes
                  ...
me laugh, he's quite basic but he's perfect for being surrounded by such different girls
The girls are various and very different from each other, let's say that each one represents a different ""stereotype"".
In the anime we saw the ""horny"" girl, the tsundere, the shy girl, the scholar, the mad scientist and the mommy (literally)
They are treated very well, every one of them
Coming to the trashy and funny part... the good thing is that it's made to be exactly trash and it works because it makes you laugh a lot and I sincerely hope they will make other season

ART
The drawings are really well done, each frame is a joy to behold and the variety of characters and beautiful animations make everything more beautiful and heavenly to look at

MUSIC
The beautiful posts are absolutely always spot on
Opening and ending are wonderful both to hear and to see

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"Most rom-com with harem elements these days involve a protagonist with 3 or more girls throwing themselves at him. What if we get a show where a protagonist has to date 100 girls? 
It's not easy to focus a story about one guy and him potentially getting together with 100 girls. Think about it, the minimal amount of episodes the show needs would be 100 episodes, assuming one per girl per episode, yet we get just a 12-episode season. Obviously, the anime wasn't going t have the protagonist Rentarou Aijo accomplishing this goal. It hasn't even been accomplished in the manga yet. The promotional material
                  ...
made it clear that it's a harem seeker, with no reason other than for Rentaro to accomplish his goal. There's a deeper reason for that if you look no further than the synopsis. However, Rentarou's journey to capturing the hearts of 100 girls is far complicated than it looks.

The show takes no more than one episode to make its point clear: for our main protagonist to fall in love with girls. This anime isn't deceptive and honestly never hides its intentions from day one. We also can't say Rentarou is a cheater by having 'affairs' as he is open about engaging in polyamory. As such, in a way, this anime deconstructs the typical tropes of a rom-com with our protagonist having relationships with multiple girls. He's not commited to one single female character and there's no route to 'best girl wins'. To emphasize this idea, the show bought together a variety of cast into the show ranging from tsunderes to the shy type, to mad scientist genius, and even the older mom type. Several of these characters are introduced from character promotional videos and we get standalone episodes to make each stand out. As with most rom-coms that mixes in with the harem genre, expect misunderstandings and a whole lot of drama.

Concidentially, The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, REALLY Love You runs on a script that has similar themes as Girlfriend, Girlfriend, another rom-com harem in the same season. Both are about a protagonist trying to build relationships with multiple girls at once. This show obviously extends that to far more than 4 girls and if we look at the bigger picture, it seemed to be the author's intention's from the start. Rentarou's first lovers includes Hakari and Karane in the first episodes. It's an important step for him to achieve his ultimate goal as these two forcefully bring out a side Rentarou himself didn't even realize. It's a test to see if he can truly fall in love. Because of the main intention of the show, the direction is fairly obvious and you really shouldn't expect anything else than the girls falling in love with Rentarou and vice versa. In fact, any significant character with a given name of the female sex falls for him for one reason or other. Even cold ice queens like Nano Eiai isn't immune.

Against all odds, this show does carry an abundant amount of emotional content evident in some of the later episodes. Even though Rentarou wants to fufill his goal, he's also truly fallen for the girls he encounters, just in different ways and circumstances. He's also an honest person who doesn't lie, cheat, or manipulate to get what he wants. The show builds on his personality that tries to match with each girls through experimental-like episodes. Some of these episodes including going on individual dates while others have him deal with emotional problems in relationships. On one occasion, the show decide to throw logic out the window and turns our female cast into mindless lovebirds. You'll have to see and experience just how outrageous that turns out.

However, I won't deny that this anime runs into repetitive gags and falls into many harem traps you can experience in similar anime. The predicable nature of the story also kills any suspense on why Rentarou will get along with because let's face it, he's there to get all the girls. It's one of those rom-coms that is too straightforward and aimed at an audience who can turn their brains off and experience what this anime is. Yes, you don't need much thinking to get how and why Rentarou wants to get 100 girlfriends to like him.

Combining the asthetics of the manga and cherography, the anime adaptation faithfully brings our cast to life. It's a very colorful adaptation filled with cherry colors and playful vibe. The female cast is built with charisma in mind along with their overexaggerated expressions. It plays on their character personalities and evokes them during memorable moments. While Rentarou himself doesn't hold any distinctive features, he's often forced to react like how a harem protagonist would. Oh and I do want to mention this show has one of the more classy theme songs of the season. 

I'm not going to sit here and say sets the gold standard of a rom-com/harem. Obviously, it doesn't but with all the entertainment it offers, it deserves a spot on the must-watch season of 2023. And with more episodes coming, you can bet that Rentarou is on his way to get those 100 girlfriends.",Reviewer’s Rating: 7,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54714/Kimi_no_Koto_ga_Daidaidaidaidaisuki_na_100-nin_no_Kanojo/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/59457/Haite_Kudasai_Takamine-san/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/52709/Danjo_no_Yuujou_wa_Seiritsu_suru_Iya_Shinai/reviews

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"This anime should not work. It's morally dubious, completely harebrained, extremely uncomfortable to watch, and… I absolutely adore it.

Now let's make something clear—in real life, polyamory is not a good idea. A single romantic relationship is difficult enough to navigate, and you're telling me the protagonist of this show intends to have a HUNDRED girlfriends? It's impossible. Physically, mentally, emotionally, there's not a man on this Earth who could make that work to the satisfaction of all parties involved.

… So it's a damn good thing this is anime and not reality.

And I think that's the secret, really. 100 Girlfriends is fully aware of how stupid
                  ...
its premise is, which is why it presents as a comedy first and foremost. Its characters are obvious tropes. Its plot devices are convenient to the point of parody. It delivers gag after ridiculous gag, a number of them fourth-wall-breaking. The show all but sends you a handwritten letter saying, ""This is one gigantic joke; please don't take it seriously.""

But that's exactly where its power lies.

The moment you accept the fact that the surface elements of this anime are not intended to be believed, the sooner you can focus on everything else—and everything else the show has to offer is fantastic.

For one, it's hilarious; 100 Girlfriends leans into its absurdist tendencies to get serious mileage out of the heroines' affection for Rentarou being so extreme it's practically deranged. And Rentarou, for his part, lives up to their adoration by being the most impossibly cool fictional man ever written. And this brings up a point that I think is worth talking about.

Despite the impossibility of everything in this anime, Rentarou is truly an admirable character. He's thoughtful. He's hard-working. He cares deeply about others. This ain't just another stupid, horny monkey who wins the anime bullcrap lottery and gets all the girls; Rentarou deserves his popularity by being, in the strangest way imaginable, the ultimate role model for men. His girlfriends are more precious to him than anything, and he puts their needs above his own every moment of every day.

The whole story is ridiculous and laughable, but what Rentarou pours out on a regular basis—his continuing effort to serve, protect, and give of himself—is genuine love, and there's nothing funny about it.

Which brings me to the other part of the show that makes no sense:
It's… wholesome.

When 100 Girlfriends wasn't making me laugh my ribs loose, it was making me smile the dumbest, happiest smile I think I've ever had on my face while watching anime. Despite what you might think, despite how raunchy the show may get, the heroines are taken seriously as characters. They worry about little things. They have hangups. Their personalities clash and they argue. But they're all united by Rentarou. His positive influence in their lives brings them closer together, until they actually start to feel like a family, even when he's not around. It's downright delightful to see, and I cannot fathom how a show with a premise this dumb manages to do this better than most anime I've watched.

Do I have objections to… well, a lot of the things in this anime? On principle, yes, absolutely. But if you're an intelligent human being with a functioning frontal lobe who can tell when someone is cracking a joke, you will be able to tell that the most questionable elements of this show exist for humor and everything that doesn't is absolutely worth your time.

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"100 Girlfriends is a comedic goldmine of harem parody and waifu baiting. While some jokes don't land as well as others, the show's commitment to the premise and love of this ridiculous genre make it one of most enjoyable this season.

STORY 4/5
100 Girlfriends is not aiming to be an avant-garde masterpiece of storytelling. However, relative to other harems this show has nearly limitless gag joke opportunities and unironically has interesting stakes if the MC fails to love one of his soul mates. Additionally, having all the characters date immediately is not only hilarious, but adeptly avoids the most notorious problem of harem anime: dragging out
                  ...
the conclusion a la Rent-A-Girlfriend and making characters less likeable to do so. Yet, despite the show's emphasis on gags, as of Episode 3, don't be surprised if the show catches you off guard and genuinely pulls at your heartstrings. This trend is still alive and well as of Episode 6, suggesting that it's balancing its humor and serious moments as well as Rentaro is balancing his time between five girlfriends.

CHARACTERS 4/5
All of the love interests' mystical infatuation with the male MC, as well as his sincerity and lack of dating inexperience gives this show a lot of armor against typical pitfalls of harem anime. These qualities allow the writers to play with every conceivable -dere imaginable, pull out great comedy from them, and avoid frustrating cliches because it is already making fun of these character tropes. Like Komi Can't Communicate, the jokes and sheer quantity of characters nearly guarantees encountering someone a viewer can enjoy, whether comedic or sincerely tender-hearted. Also, Rentaro is without a doubt one of the best harem protagonists out there.

ANIMATION 4/5
I originally said that the animation is not extraordinary, but honestly it has maintained really high quality for these 6 episodes. There is a genuinely impressive fight in Episode 4 or 5. The compositing is good, the lighting is great, the animation is not distracting, and frames have been maximized to comedic effect. 

SOUND 4/5
The show understands the value of music and environmental noises to maximize its comedy. 

CONCLUSION
I wasn't even planning to watch this show this season and now it's one that I'm looking forward to most each week. I've laughed out loud multiple times. It is not a serious romance though, so if anyone goes into it expecting that, they're better off watching Our Dating Story from this season. However,  fans of gag comedies like Komi Can't Communicate, Gintama, and Grand Blue Dreaming will likely find this very amusing and even more so if you're a harem fan.",Reviewer’s Rating: 8,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54714/Kimi_no_Koto_ga_Daidaidaidaidaisuki_na_100-nin_no_Kanojo/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/59457/Haite_Kudasai_Takamine-san/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/52709/Danjo_no_Yuujou_wa_Seiritsu_suru_Iya_Shinai/reviews

So, naturally, he decides to date all of them. It’s as chaotic as it sounds, but that’s what makes it fun.

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"This was my first ever review on MAL, and I couldn't think of a better anime to start with. The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You is pure, unapologetic chaos—and I loved every second of it.

Season 1 had me laughing out loud more times than I can count. Rentarou is an absolute madman of a protagonist, genuinely giving his all to each girlfriend like it’s the most natural thing in the world—and somehow, it works. The characters are insanely fun, the humor never misses, and the pacing keeps the energy high without ever feeling rushed.

My favorite moment? When Rentarou introduces
                  ...
Shizuka to Karane and Hakari—and Shizuka, in her text-to-speech glory, calls Karane “Lady Karane,” and Karane just casually responds, “Yeah you can drop the lady part, just call me bruh or something.” I died. That scene lives in my head rent-free.

The anime is also packed with meta-humor, clever fourth wall breaks, and anime references that feel like love letters to fans. The animation is colorful, expressive, and matches the ridiculousness perfectly.

I genuinely don’t have anything negative to say about Season 1. If you’re into absurd rom-coms with a self-aware twist, 100 Kanojo is a must-watch. It’s one of the rare shows where the more it leans into its premise, the better it gets.",Reviewer’s Rating: 10,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54714/Kimi_no_Koto_ga_Daidaidaidaidaisuki_na_100-nin_no_Kanojo/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/59457/Haite_Kudasai_Takamine-san/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/52709/Danjo_no_Yuujou_wa_Seiritsu_suru_Iya_Shinai/reviews

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"I started this anime on a whim; I needed a work that could make me laugh. I came across the title ""100 Girlfriends Who Really Love You,"" which seemed completely crazy to me, so I decided to give it a try. I honestly expected a rather typical harem, with a very clueless boy not understanding situations, succeeding in everything, and magically attracting the love of all the girls. That's exactly what happens, but the significant difference is that the series' humor doesn't revolve AROUND that but rather revolves AROUND it. In many harems, humor is predominantly centered on very sexualized and random situations, but ""100
                  ...
Girlfriend"" managed to find a broader sense of humor while keeping the harem aspect at the core of the work!

Another strong point of the series is that each character manages to have a distinct personality, different from the others. Even Rentaro, who has all the traits of a basic harem protagonist, stands out and surprises us. ""100 Girlfriend"" built its foundation on the classic harem but added its own flavor and humor, and I found it genuinely successful!

I'm looking forward to the continuation of this story, although I remain skeptical about whether he will actually end up with 100 girlfriends. I fear that the work might eventually go too far and lose what made it charming in the first place. Characters may lose their distinct personalities, and the humor may become more like typical harems, losing the spark that made me enjoy watching the first season. In short, I find it challenging to envision the long-term direction of this work, but I hope it will continue to surprise me in the future, just as the first season did!

On a side note, I really enjoyed the musicality of the opening, and I think it perfectly fits the work!",Reviewer’s Rating: 7,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54714/Kimi_no_Koto_ga_Daidaidaidaidaisuki_na_100-nin_no_Kanojo/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/59457/Haite_Kudasai_Takamine-san/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/52709/Danjo_no_Yuujou_wa_Seiritsu_suru_Iya_Shinai/reviews
Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"There’s something in the water with shows with the word “Girlfriend” in it this season. You have Girlfriend, Girlfriend’s second season, which was a hilarious sequel, and then there’s this one, something quite special honestly in the harem genre, a genre that is seen as low-brow entertainment. A guy that gets together with so many girls, one might say it’s a bit of a wish fulfillment fantasy, but when one watches it, from the outset, there’s just something different about it.

I always say that if a show is trashy, it might as well be as unhinged as possible, and this one certainly understood that assignment.
                  ...
The premise is pretty stupid, as it’s about a guy, Aijou Rentarou, who confessed to one hundred girls, only to be rejected every time, and then as one would certainly expect, divine intervention was needed to get this guy the rizz he needed. A slip of the finger because God was playing a video game, and Rentarou was given one hundred soulmates that he could find, the kicker being that they had to get together or else the girl would die.

So what’s so unique about this harem anime? Yeah, there’s its fair share of fan service, but what I found that was great about this anime was its self-awareness that it’s trashy, and so the comedy is very self-aware as well, and breaks the fourth wall often. It’s very meta, as people might say, which is probably why people enjoyed the manga in the first place, the fast pace of comedy that has references of media that we’ve seen before, which can always provide that extra chuckle that other comedies might not be able to do. Unlike shows like Rent-a-Girlfriend, this anime thrives by not taking itself seriously, while still having moments that develop the characters.

The comedy is great and all, but the real draw of this anime is the main male character. Harem protagonists are usually the most one-note, boring characters ever, as they almost always follow the same trope of taking way too long to either recognize the love interest’s feelings, or taking too long to confess. Rentarou however, is probably the best harem protagonist I’ve seen in a while, mostly because he shatters all those tropes, and somehow can effectively care for every single girlfriend he encounters. As each girlfriend gets into the picture, they also have their time to shine, and it’s not just superficial development either, there’s actual heart behind it. Who could have thought? A harem anime with genuine heart and soul poured into it!

I expected that I would like this anime, but I’m coming out of it genuinely surprised at how wholesome it was even with the dumb premise. It embraces its stupidity and is shameless to the maximum, and it proved to be one of the best anime to watch every week, and honestly was one of the best anime of the year in terms of pure enjoyment.

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"Disclaimer: This is an opinion, and opinions are subjective, you can have your own opinion and we don’t need to hurt each other because of an arbitrary review on the internet 

The 100 Girlfriends Who Really Love You is a harem anime, a very hated genre of anime however, this anime does harem pretty well, while not being entirely perfect.

Let's start with the positives,

This show is really entertaining, the interactions are interesting, the main character is relatively likable and not completely generic, as well as the other characters in contrast with the main character make a great synergy. This synergy between the characters make this
                  ...
show entertaining and fun to watch. The music is pretty good, it’s subtle and usually fits the theme of the situation. The good and subtle music combined with synergistic characters have made a show that is very entertaining to watch.

Moving onto the ok of the show,

The plot is ridiculous, however the story isn’t too bad nor too good. How the show introduces the characters is not the greatest, the only character that had an interesting way of being introduced was the pink haired girl’s mother since she actually had a plot that led up to it. Other than that all of the other characters being introduced are bland, uninteresting and repetitive. Every girl besides the mother is “The main character and the girl meet at a certain place, then they fall in love.”  The comedy is pretty mediocre, there is a variety of jokes however 60% of them are sexual jokes. The sexual jokes are very uninspired and generic, “OOOOOO tsundere girl has smaller breasts and she’s jealous,” or “Trying to peep on someone however it doesn't goes to plan,” or “One of the girl’s has a sexual reaction to them being tickled.” The other 40% of jokes are pretty good, like the Tokyo Ghoul reference, the crossdressing scene even though it was kind of sexual but not really, although the scene before it is generic. The story is hit or miss and although subjective, the comedy is done sometimes well and sometimes not. 

Finally the bad,

Tsundere girl is neglected throughout the show, she really doesn’t have any impactful moments throughout the show, she just kind of exists. Tsundere girl is also your incredibly boring, bland, generic tsundere character in every harem. This anime also quite frequently switched up what it’s trying to be at episode 9 and on. It tries to be more dramatic, and switch to be more emotional, I believe it should just be what it’s trying to be. The emotional scenes also feel kind of, over exaggerated, sometimes forced, and at the end of the scene they kind of just brush it off. 

In the end, The 100 Girlfriends Who Really Love You is pretty good, it’s entertaining, the characters synergize well, however the more emotional switch up at episode 9 and afterwards aren’t done too well. However this doesn’t change the opinion of The 100 Girlfriends Who Really Love You of being a well made anime.",Reviewer’s Rating: 7,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54714/Kimi_no_Koto_ga_Daidaidaidaidaisuki_na_100-nin_no_Kanojo/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/59457/Haite_Kudasai_Takamine-san/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/52709/Danjo_no_Yuujou_wa_Seiritsu_suru_Iya_Shinai/reviews
Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"The Boyfriend Is Me.

Whilst other protagonists of lesser harem romcoms are endlessly spiralling around in an endless malaise of ‘will they, won’t they’ bullshit with all the women who are attracted to them for reasons unknown just so a plot can happen, Rentarou was at the forge, sharpening his blades and pouring his soul in them. As he draws his two new Zanpakt- I mean four leaf clovers, one containing the soul of ecchi harem romcom bullshit and the other containing the soul of good writing, self-awareness and parody almost rivalling Gintama, he comes to the self-realisation that he is him and that The 100
                  ...
Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You is currently the peak of trashy harem anime. 

Rentarou is so full of love to give by the time he’d started high school he had already taken 100 shots at love only to be turned down every time despite everyone around him acknowledging all of his rizz. It turns out the god of love screwed up his paperwork whilst he was watching Castle in the Sky and he has accidentally assigned Rentarou with 100 soulmates that he’ll meet throughout high school with the small caveat that if he doesn’t find and happily date his 100 soulmates they’ll be sad and die from unfortunate circumstances. Rentarou, being the greatest Chad of our generation, sets out to find and love all 100 girlfriends. 

That pretext is only an excuse to have one guy date a hundred girlfriends, but where 100 Girlfriends stands out from its harem anime contemporaries is that it knows exactly what it is and it takes full advantage of that knowledge for the sake of humour. Even the characters know they’re in a harem anime. If you think this is another Rent-A-Girlfriend-style harem anime that takes itself way too seriously despite being complete garbage then you’d better think again. 100 Girlfriends is fully committed to its absurdest premise and outrageously shameless humour whilst also managing to create a harem of genuinely likeable characters who all have believable relationships not only with Rentarou but with each other. 

Rentarou isn’t your typical harem MC. Not only is has insanely likeable, but he takes initiative and puts himself out there for his girlfriends. He’s sincere in understanding and loving every one of his girlfriends and whilst he does help them overcome some of their unique circumstances he doesn’t free them from their problems. He plays more of a supportive boyfriend role whilst the girls lean on him and the other girlfriends to overcome their challenges unless the story requires his insane power level. 
Of course, the girlfriends are the entire reason 100 Girlfriends is such a good show. All of their designs range from insanely cute to insanely hot, courtesy of series manga artist Nozawa’s ex-Doushjin/hentai days, and they all represent certain conventional/ nonconventional anime/manga ‘dere’ tropes that the story likes to explore, expand upon and have fun with. The five girlfriends we know of are Hakari the lustfully thicc one, Karane the Tsundere who acts as the straight man in the face of all the absurdity. Shizuka the bookworm who suffers from a communication disorder and can only communicate through her favourite books, Nano the kuudere who is so emotionlessly efficient she might be a robot, and Kusuri who is willing to try meth and loves making drugs with various side effects. They’re all perfect. I love them all.

Of course, I wouldn’t be praising the anime adaption to high heaven if it wasn’t for the animators at Bibury Animation Studios who 100% understood the assignment given to them. It’s easy to get distracted from all the great character writing and funny jokes from how good the art and animation are. Rarely do character’s faces fall off-model whilst other parts of their bodies jiggle and bounce and despite the manga already being pretty degenerate, the animators seemed to have full creative licence to add as many gags and references and body inflation as they like. It’s really wonderful to watch an anime where is obvious the creators had so much fun making it. Especially a harem anime. 

If I had some nitpicks I’d say that the Crunchyroll subs can sometimes be a bit… much. As a diehard fan of the manga, I know what the characters should be saying but seeing some of the dialogue replaced with relevant internet lingo comes off as a bit try-hard. 

Apart from that, The 100 Girlfriends Who Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Love You is brilliant. A show spouting the virtues of inclusivity and pro-feminism disguised as a harem anime for degenerates. A harem anime that made Girlfriend Girlfriend completely irrelevant as soon as it started airing. Of course, like most harem anime there is a lot of anime bullshit that will likely turn off those who hold anime to a high standard but 100 Girlfriends fully earns its degeneracy because it doesn’t rely on it. This is one of those shows which is all about having fun and you really shouldn't think too hard about some of its more questionable material. With a cast of characters who are all loveable, and assertive and a relationship(s) that is so fun to watch, 100 Girlfriends fully understands that relationships are more akin to projects to be worked upon and improved together rather than end goals. And there are still 95 of these projects to watch unfold. I can’t wait for season 2.

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"Why is this anime so good??!! For real it goes by so quickly, and I'm sad that S1 is almost over.

As the title suggests this anime is about a guy who is destined to be the true love of 100 girls, and according to the lore of this world. If you don't date your true love they will die a lonely death, so yes indeed the guys solution is to make a harem so no one dies. This season he gets with a few of them, and yes they are all in agreement of this arrangement.

While the show doesn't have a lot of what it's
                  ...
about. Its what happens in each and every episode that makes this anime super great. Last time I've seen a harem anime this good would probably have to be Highschool DxD, and this is arguably way better in terms of comedy. (Small Edit: Scratch that Oresuki best comedy harem and this is equal to that). At first I saw this and was like oh a harem anime. It's probably like all the others, but then it had me hooked. As the season is ending it really escalated in comedy, and I can't even image what is coming later if they make a S2 or P2. 

My only worry is that because it's 100 characters that'll eventually be introduced that a lot of them will become background characters, and while that did happen a bit to the current few girlfriends the anime hasn't lost it's touch yet.

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"I usually try to avoid harem if I can, but my anime FOMO doesn’t let me when I see something high rated for the season. 

For a harem, I’d say it’s pretty decent. God telling the MC he will meet 100 soulmates in high school and the one he doesn’t date, DIE so he’s trying to be with all of them. I didn’t read the manga, but this anime will be super long if he’s really going to be with 100 girls. Three episodes in, so far only 3 girls have been introduced. They all have a different personality, and I really like Karane because

she’s a cute tsundere. She’s more interesting and funny to me compared to the other two so far. 

The one thing that gets on my nerves about this anime and kills it for me is the male MC. He’s like a nervous, screamy boy and I hate that. Have 3 girlfriends yet you’re still acting like a baby. I know he doesn’t have a choice but to date all of them, but he’s still sleezy in his own way, but I can ignore all that since the show is entertaining overall. 

I do like the animations of the show and the comedic expressions. It’s what you’d expect from any school shojo harem anime. 

If you enjoy romance, this one is a little funny and entertaining. It’s a lighthearted watch which I’d recommend because the concept is silly.

Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"This is straight up ridiculous and dirty . 
Listen I know that dirt is fine in animes but seriously can we at this point let actual good story have better animations than whatever this is . 

The story has many awful scenes or near nude scenes or wierd sounds licking etc . 

The story is straight up bullshit but gives you an interest from the title that how is such an anime even possible. The story is basically a man getting 100 girlfriends and him making them his gfs and they all fighting for his love or staying together since they love him . 

The
                  ...
ideal of love here is something a crazy kid would write . 

The worst is that there's a boom in the heart then all girls like crazy fall in love with the ml . 
Only one so far the blue haired one seems actual a somewhat sane love interest/gf but she looks like a little girl who just needed a friend. 

Story- horrible honestly I thought it after showing that he got 100 gfs because those are his soulmates there would be atleast one percent of complication of not wanting this soulmate situation or some solution to avoid this but whatever the story itself is just him soo many gfs and all being crazy in love and some fan service scenes in between. 

Each episode it gets worse the idea of love and soulmate is already let's say the most unhinged and weird one here . 

Charachters - I only like the blue haired girl . 
The Ml - let's say it he's fine average , little kind hearted that's all 

The pink haired gf - she is the most annoying because she is like a girl who would do anything to get the ml ( using her body or whatever To get on his good side closer ) honestly every girl is written so bad and unrealistic or just like they don't even make sense for how they written . 

The purple hair one is / ai one is written as someone super intelligent but then she goes licking wounds or doing the most stupid or average behaviour which doesn't make sense for someone you're writing as smart . 

The yellow like hair one is a little fine like she is blunt and obvious about how ridiculous all of this is but she too is in love for no reason this story is all about they're his soulmate and they will fall in love with him anyways and they will actually all wierd for his love . 

The vice principal charachter is soo disgusting like this anime all characters are written in such a way which makes you think which is more disgusting or embarrassing. 

Honestly was hoping that there will be a single good ep but 6 episodes and the whole idea of the story is ridiculous and so are the episodes i just don't understand how such a story got an anime with nife animation are there boob or nude animation industry which will animate any anime with fan service scenes because the story is definitely not the reason this got an anime . 

Save your time and sanity this anime is only for those who want a little fanservice scenes or interested in just watching the anime due to the name. 

The worst to me is always now such anime get even made in first place I know there's an audience out there for it but even then some stories have actually some good story despite weird scenes this neither has story neither anything great about it . Just complete story written by someone's intrusive or bad thoughts and without ability to write a good story just random ideas packed one after another about the kinds of girls the ml will get one after another .",Reviewer’s Rating: 4,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54714/Kimi_no_Koto_ga_Daidaidaidaidaisuki_na_100-nin_no_Kanojo/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/59457/Haite_Kudasai_Takamine-san/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/52709/Danjo_no_Yuujou_wa_Seiritsu_suru_Iya_Shinai/reviews
Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"There is no genre in otaku media more notoriously stagnant than harem. Since the progression of anime romcom from Rumiko Takahashi-style love polygons to Love Hina-style harems, the genre’s tropes and structure have changed very little. Plenty of good shows have been cast in that mold, but for most of its reign viewers have craved an antidote.

The typical harem anime progression looks something like: protagonist is introduced, meets a series of girls, girls fall in love with him, drawn out will they won’t they tension, manga stops making money, protagonist picks winning girl. This formula is not without strengths (seeing your favorite win is an
                  ...
unparalleled high, and the internet arguments are fun), but the extended period of romantic stagnation before the conclusion can create boredom.

A clean solution to this structural problem is polyamory. Rather than waiting for one girl to win, every girl wins. The possibilities after that are endless. Tension between the harem members, lesbian romance, and straightforward friendship are all paths with distinct strengths. Hyakkano does all of these, and makes it all even more efficient by way of a clever plot device.

All of Rentarou’s hundred soulmates instantly fall in love with him upon first meeting eyes, skipping the extended “developing feelings” phase present in most romances. This keeps the pace satisfyingly quick, and explains why women are willing to date a man who already has like seventy girlfriends. This doesn’t completely eliminate early romantic progression. Rentarou still needs to convince his soulmates to go out with him, and all of them have a reason for loving him more compelling than the stock harem “he saved me from a big monster” or “we met as kids”. This preserves the best parts of early romance, and spares us the moral implications of a magic bond forcing two people together.

This structure can’t work without great characters, and Hyakkano does not skimp in that department. Rentarou Aijou is one of the best harem protagonists of all time. He’s earnest, hard working, and emotionally intelligent enough to avoid typical romance anime misunderstandings. He genuinely cares about all his girlfriends, and is willing to go to absurd lengths to make them happy (like in that Schrödinger's kiss scheme). Basically, he has immense rizz outside the magic. It's never confusing why any of his girlfriends want to date him, his 100 rejections in middle school make less sense.

His first two girlfriends, Hanazono Hakari and Inda Karane, are both wonderful and compliment each other perfectly. Karane at first appears to be a simple parody of the tsundere archetype, but her rivalry/friendship with Hakari and perpetual role as harem tsukkomi give her plenty of comedic mileage beyond that. The way Hakari’s aggressive romantic moves force Karane to action is always entertaining, as are Hakari’s reactions to the introduction of new girlfriends.

Yoshimoto Shizuka fills the quiet girl archetype, and does so well. She’s a nice shy counterbalance to the first two members of Rentarou’s family, and the way she struggles to engage in harem activities due to social anxiety is always charming. That creates cute moments when the other girls go out of their way to include her. The author has clearly considered how each member’s introduction will affect the harem’s chemistry.

What surprised me most about this show is just how well its romance works outside of comedy. The buildup of Rentarou’s relationship with Shizuka was genuinely heartwarming, as was his decision to ask both Hakari and Karane to date him. The romance works more than I ever expected from a show about one man dating one hundred girls.

Kusuri’s name means drug and she loves drugs, but hasn’t done meth yet. So, she’s relatable to me personally, and I love her. Her presence revives a great trope that got lost in the Takahashi-Love Hina paradigm shift, the magic potion plot. Kusuri's entire plot function is pumping out magic potions, in more variation than is typical. She still hasn’t made meth though, can’t wait for that episode.

I’ll stop myself with the character breakdowns here, but everyone I’m leaving out is just as awesome. There’s one character in particular the show keeps a surprise, and I don’t plan on ruining that. Bottom line: these characters are never one note, and have meaningful interactions with each other, not just the protagonist. That automatically makes the cast more engaging than that of most harem anime.

I was initially worried about the adaptation due to studio choice. Bibury doesn’t exactly have a great track record, even their good shows look pretty bad. Thankfully, the staff pulled through on this one. The show has fantastic art direction and consistently good animation, both of which compliment its tone and match the humor perfectly. The fanservice in particular benefits from this (and there is plenty of it). That’s a key part of what elevates this above its contemporaries.

Hyakkano is a genuinely innovative show that delivers the best parts of harem anime (confessions, fanservice scenes, emotional character arcs, absurd comedy, and gay stuff) as efficiently as possible. It is a landmark achievement, and it gives me faith harem, and anime romcoms are alive.",Reviewer’s Rating: 9,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54714/Kimi_no_Koto_ga_Daidaidaidaidaisuki_na_100-nin_no_Kanojo/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/59457/Haite_Kudasai_Takamine-san/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/52709/Danjo_no_Yuujou_wa_Seiritsu_suru_Iya_Shinai/reviews
Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"I'm giving this a 6 just for two reasons
1.The first half made me laugh a LOT , like it was so dumb and obviously parody that i loved how stupid everything was 
2.The animation is gorgeous, they didn't need to go that hard for this but the animators went wild with some scenes 

I would gladly give it a 7 even and 8 if it wasnt because of the last 3 episodes, the mom....the mom.
Look i get that this is a parody of comedy and harem anime but there's times where a joke is just too much or is just not funny at all, i
                  ...
haven't seen one of those distasteful bathroom scenes since the 2010's and i sure didn't miss them , just because you make the joke with the opposite genders doesnt make it funny 
And y know...is just weird, i went ahead and finished the series cuz i was already 9 episodes in might as well just endure it but even when i had those last 3 episodes on the side while i did something else i was uncomfy all the time lol and look i don't care for most of the jokes i even tolerated the red haired girl but the mom was just too far for me

I'm sure some people love that, good for you! is not my thing, not at all. I was expecting a parody anime and it kind of is but it tries to be taken seriously at times and you really can't be both at once",Reviewer’s Rating: 6,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54714/Kimi_no_Koto_ga_Daidaidaidaidaisuki_na_100-nin_no_Kanojo/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/59457/Haite_Kudasai_Takamine-san/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/52709/Danjo_no_Yuujou_wa_Seiritsu_suru_Iya_Shinai/reviews
Kimi no Koto ga Daidaidaidaidaisuki na 100-nin no Kanojo,"Hyakkano initially started off as a parody to the harem trope, in the sense that the jokes poke fun at the usual romance paths and introductions. But quickly, the shown as grown into a true and well-developed romance show itself.

We have our male protagonist Aijo Rentaro, who is pleasantly assertive. He actually pursues the girls and gets them in a convincing way. He is also very respectful of them, without coming off a some sort of beta cuck. And the girls reciprocate by showing him their affection.

The girls themselves are also exceptional and not just there just for the sake of being obtained, they have
                  ...
a surprising amount of character development. From a shy, quiet girl who tries to open up, to a academic focused girl learning about the necessity of fun, to a tsundere who's body conscious and learns to accept her own form of appeal.

The art is also great, making the girls highly attractive. Mixed in with ample, but not overbearing fan service, and it's a show that you'll want to play over and over again.

The OP and ED are also great. The OP being satirical in nature, while the ED being more cute and lovey.

Overall, this show condenses the drawn out nature of courtship of most other romance comedy shows (like Kaguya-sama), and leaves a very satisfying conclusion because everything is done with sincerity and bravery on the male's part; as opposed to the usual ""finally, they got together"".",Reviewer’s Rating: 10,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54714/Kimi_no_Koto_ga_Daidaidaidaidaisuki_na_100-nin_no_Kanojo/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/59457/Haite_Kudasai_Takamine-san/reviewshttps://myanimelist.net/anime/52709/Danjo_no_Yuujou_wa_Seiritsu_suru_Iya_Shinai/reviews
